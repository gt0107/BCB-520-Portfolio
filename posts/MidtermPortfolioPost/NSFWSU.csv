The cluster of GPU-accelerated computers, with their vastly greater density of small compute cores and matrix processors, will radically speed up computationally intensive tasks in machine-learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI), genomics, and simulation.  Through this speedup, Camas will provide new capabilities for scientific computing in research areas ranging from computer hardware design using deep learning to plant genome analysis and climate modeling.<br/><br/>Camas will enable GPU-accelerated research that focuses on three key scientific and engineering research pillars. These pillars are software and hardware development using ML, simulation and analysis of natural systems, and big data analytics for infrastructure management, planning, and decision making. Applications that leverage GPU acceleration as well as AI and ML range from astrophysics and quantum information science, to modeling coupled human-natural systems and chemically-reactive transport, to decision making that optimizes demand response in electricity markets.  The Camas cluster will strengthen a broad spectrum of research areas, promote the synergistic transfer of knowledge across disciplines, and increase collaborative opportunities both within the University as well as with regional and national partners. Through a breadth of collaboration that spans three of WSU's major campuses and five different Colleges, Camas will have broad impact in nucleating AI-driven research efforts throughout the WSU system as well as fostering training opportunities for students in AI, ML, and data science.  Through partnerships with student-led groups including the Python and R Working Groups, as well as the Office of Undergraduate Education, Camas will increase student engagement in research computing including strategic activities that create a pathway for increasing participation of underrepresented groups in STEM.  The new computational capabilities and the concomitant development of HPC computational literacy throughout the research community will further enable additional regional partnerships and engagement opportunities for both faculty and students. A project website and repository for Camas that holds links to research artifacts and details of project activities will be housed at https://hpc.wsu.edu/camas.

School districts across the country need more secondary computer science teachers, especially those who share the identities, values, and lived experiences of the students they teach. However, pathways for preparing and supporting computer science teachers are only just emerging, and many are struggling to recruit promising teachers into the profession and retain them long term. This project seeks to serve students and teachers who are women, African-Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, and/or disabled, specifically by creating pathways into computer science teaching for teachers with these identities. This project will create a consortium of emerging pre-service programs across the Pacific Northwest to address, strengthen, and mature computer science teaching pathways in four ways: 1) organizing and sharing information about teaching pathways, 2) identifying and resolving key barriers to pathways that aspiring teachers face, 3) supporting computers science teacher community building in partnership with new and existing computer science teachers association chapters, and 4) supporting administrative leaders who manage and grow these pathways. <br/><br/>The CSforAll High School Strand project?s approach is to build an evidence-based networked improvement community, which deeply engages stakeholders across the region to identify opportunities for change, develop sustainable cross-institutional coordination practices, and use research as one tool of many to inform approaches to change. Research will particularly focus on answering 1) who is and isn?t informed about CS teaching pathways, and why; 2) what barriers aspiring teacher with identities marginalized in CS face in pursuing CS teaching careers; 3) how community gatherings amongst teachers with marginalized identities can support teacher retention; and 4) how solidarity amongst teacher education administrative leaders can support sustainability of pathways. These questions will be posed across urban and rural divides, helping to inform how values, communities, and state politics shape equitable access to computer science education in secondary schools across the Pacific Northwest.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Tso Morari complex in northern India represents one of the largest and youngest of these ultrahigh pressure terranes. The size and youth of this complex, coupled with analytical advances over the last decade, permit us to collect uniquely precise metamorphic pressures, temperatures, ages, and structural measurements across a wide geographic region. These spatially distributed datasets will allow us to discriminate among competing models for how such ultrahigh pressure rocks form and are exhumed during continental collisions. This work will advance science and US interests by supporting the directed research and education efforts of 2 PhD students and 2-6 undergraduate students. Additional educational benefits will accrue to as many as 25 geology majors per year at Boise State University in mineralogy and petrology classes, 25 geology majors per year at Washington State University in a structural geology class, and 1500 undergraduates per year at Washington State University in general geology classes. Both Boise State and Washington State Universities serve an unusual demographic with high Latino and military veteran student populations. Co-PI Long recruits students at local community colleges, which will allow research results and educational opportunities to be disseminated to a broader regional audience. Both PIs will also present results at the Wadia Institute, India, reaching a broad international demographic and advancing science internationally.<br/><br/>Ultrahigh pressure metamorphic rocks form within or above the coesite stability field and are observed in many orogens. The mechanisms by which ultrahigh pressure rocks form and exhume is a long-standing problem in tectonics. Based on data collected from the Tso Morari complex in India, we will test two important hypotheses that derive from thermal-mechanical models of ultrahigh pressure metamorphism: 1) Ultrahigh pressure cycles (burial to peak P-T conditions and exhumation to ~1 GPa) occur in c. 5 Myr, and 2) Ultrahigh pressure rocks are buried, exhumed, and emplaced as coherent sheets. Specifically, we propose to answer the following questions: 1) At what time and at what pressure-temperature conditions were Tso Morari complex rocks metamorphosed, and how long did ultrahigh pressure metamorphism last? 2) At what time and at what pressure-temperature conditions did amphibolite-facies overprinting occur, and how long did the Tso Morari complex rocks remain hot? 3) What was the rate of cooling? 4) Over what temperature range did exhumation-related shearing occur? 5) What is the spatial distribution of pressure-temperature-deformation-time paths? Data collected will include pressure-temperature conditions using inclusion and rim thermobarometry, Lu-Hf ages on pre-ultrahigh pressure garnet cores and ultrahigh pressure garnet rims, U-Pb ages on any high-U rutile inclusions, 40Ar/39Ar ages of hornblende and muscovite, quartz c-axis opening angle thermometry, and diffusion modeling of chemical gradients in garnet. Pressure-temperature-deformation-time paths will be collected from at least 8 localities located at extremes along the subduction and exhumation transport directions. Systematic along-transport differences in these paths will discriminate whether the ultrahigh pressure unit was metamorphosed and exhumed as a coherent sheet (as currently assumed) or as multiple or complex structures. Results will be integrated with diverse thermal-mechanical models of UHP metamorphism using multiple chronometers in single or proximal outcrops to minimize geographic extrapolation, determine ages along- and across-strike, make direct comparisons to published thermal-mechanical models, and identify when mid-crustal emplacement of the Tso Morari complex occurred.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this Reproducible Cells and Organoids via Directed-Differentiation Encoding (RECODE) project a team of researchers from Washington State University and Cornell University aim to provide a new tissue engineering strategy to make cartilage. Adult stem cells will be stimulated to become mature chondrocytes, the cells that make cartilage, to produce the type of tissue needed for repairing damaged cartilage. The project's approaches seek to prevent cells from transitioning to osteocytes, the cells that make bone. This will be done by using small molecules that interfere with the genes that control the production of bone. Real time imaging of fluorescing molecules will monitor whether the cells are likely to make cartilage or bone. Feedback is used to change the cell growth conditions to keep cells within an ideal range. The properties of the tissues created will be tested for their flexibility and composition. Both Washington State and Cornell will work with minority participation programs to include underrepresented students in the research.<br/><br/>This RECODE project aims to enhance tissue engineering by driving mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) toward a stable chondrogenic lineage. The goal is to move tissue constructs in the direction of a functionally organized articular cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM) and prevent osteogenesis. It is hypothesized that cell proliferation and differentiation can be controlled by feedback bioprocess shear stresses, growth factor concentration, oscillating hydrostatic pressure, and gene silencing. The team will interrogate MSC maturation with a fiber optic bundle to sense, in real-time, co-upregulation of Sox9 mRNA, critically involved in orchestrating chondrogenesis, and Runx2 mRNA, which if overexpressed will promote unwanted progression toward hypertrophic calcification and ossification. Process variables will be tied to the cellular mRNA architecture and ECM manufacture through an experimental design model that will further refine feedback control rules. Spatial and temporal validation will be performed through bulk and single cell mRNA transcriptomics, and confocal strain and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy tissue mapping. The team will leverage Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) support and partnerships with Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation programs at Washington State University and Cornell University to recruit underrepresented students with the goal to see these students transition into tissue engineering related PhD programs.<br/><br/>This RECODE project is jointly funded by the Engineering Biology and Health Cluster in the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems and the Biomechanics and Mechanobiology Program in the Division of Civil, Mechanical, and Manufacturing Innovation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Photorespiration is a plant process that recycles toxic products created as a byproduct of photosynthesis and is an essential process of plant growth. Rates of photorespiration are linked to elevated temperature and carbon dioxide concentration, meaning that future rates of photorespiration will change with changing climates. One carbon metabolism is similarly vital to plant growth, and also is the source for essential vitamins like folate. The goal of this project is to generate models predicting how current and future climatic conditions influence plant performance and yields. These models would inform breeding and engineering approaches to optimize plant productivity and the production of plant compounds important for human nutrition and health. During this interdisciplinary project, high school, undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral trainees are taught integrative approaches to plant biology, broadening their education and learning opportunities in collaborative scientific research. The aim of this activity is to instill positive attitudes towards science, and encourage creative and critical thinking by providing trainees with greater access to the scientific process early in their educational training. Underrepresented undergraduate and graduate students participate in several university programs designed to provide information on existing research opportunities to underrepresented groups at Washington State University and Michigan State University. The main public facing outreach activity of this project is a Sounds of Science performance at Washington State University, a unique collaboration between plant scientists and musicians resulting in a TED-talk styled event aimed to increase awareness of the importance of plant science. <br/><br/>Traditionally, photorespiration has been considered well defined with little metabolic flexibility. However, the PI?s recent work suggests that photorespiratory flux can alternatively be partitioned into the metabolism of tetrahydrofolate-bound one-carbon (C1) units in the cytosol. This may provide an overflow for the traditional photorespiratory pathway and has important implications for the energetics and carbon balance of photorespiration, photosynthesis, and foliar nitrogen assimilation. Therefore, it is important to define the contribution of cytosolic C1 metabolism to photorespiration, particularly in response to conditions that influence rates of photorespiration (e.g. drought and high temperature). The goal of the project is to determine the role of cytosolic C1 metabolism in photorespiration. It is hypothesized that two cytosolic C1 enzymes, formate-tetrahydrofolate ligase and serine hydroxymethyltransferase, participate in processing of formate and serine generated during photorespiration. Reverse genetics, leaf gas exchange, metabolite analyses, and labeling-assisted metabolic flux analysis are used to test the role of these two enzymes in the coordination of carbon metabolism between the C1 and photorespiratory pathways.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One cornerstone for almost all research projects focusing on better understanding major geologic events are chemical analyses of rock samples and minerals, as their geochemical inventory can be used to reconstruct processes at different scales, such as ore-genesis, continental-scale events like the eruption of Columbia River Flood Basalts that shaped the landscape of the Pacific Northwest, or how some of the Earth?s earliest crust has formed. This funding will be used to acquire a state-of-the-art laser-ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry system, replacing our current instruments at the Peter Hooper GeoAnalytical Laboratory at Washington State University (WSU) founded more than four decades ago. The Lab specializes in providing research-quality geochemical data to the national (and international) earth-science community, many projects of which are funded by the NSF. This data is used to advance our understanding of Earth?s history. To continue to fulfill our mission in the future, we need to replace our current instruments that have been in year-round operation for more than a decade, and which are no longer supported by the manufacturer. The latest generation of mass spectrometer allows for the quantification of much lower concentrations of trace elements in whole rock samples and permits the development of new approaches for reading and interpreting geochemical signatures in earth materials. The laser ablation system coupled to the mass spectrometer allows for in-situ analysis at a micrometer-scale in minerals and an almost unlimited range of materials, allowing for use of the Lab by researchers from a wide range of disciplines, such as the earth sciences, material sciences, and biological sciences. The new instrument will be central for faculty and student research at WSU, and for the Lab?s other users. With this state-of-the-art equipment we will be able to develop new analytical approaches and methods, furthering our ability to tackle long-standing questions about Earth?s history on multiple scales. Students will be trained on cutting edge analytical instruments and, therefore, this award will also directly positively impact the highly trained workforce in the field of analytical geochemistry and beyond. <br/><br/>The Peter Hooper GeoAnalytical Laboratory at Washington State University (WSU) has analyzed 12,200 bulk samples via solution Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS) over the last 5 years (2016-2021), plus more than 2000 hours of Laser Ablation (LA)ICPMS analyses in the last 3 years alone. This proposal requests funds to acquire a new state-of-the-art ICPMS and LA system for continuing and expanding the high quality and reliable services of trace element analyses for the geoscience community for the next decade and beyond. (LA)ICPMS analyses, especially in combination with XRF measurements, are employed in a broad range of Earth science research including applications in geological and environmental studies. Quantifying the composition of Earth materials, which include igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks, soils, and archeological artifacts, to name only a few, provides critical information about the samples? origins and what processes were involved in their formation. Our analytical service employing (LA)ICPMS supplies high-quality research data to a wide range of geoscientists in North America - over 100 different institutions over the last 3 years have benefited from our services. The GeoAnalytical Lab is considered a critical component of academic geoscience research in North America through the research-quality analytical services it provides, most notably but not exclusively for the geochemical research communities. Data produced by the Lab feeds basic research which informs decisions made by scientists and agencies addressing natural hazards, resource exploration, environmental challenges, and human impacts on climate. The GeoAnalytical Lab also plays an important role in training highly skilled geochemists and technicians for the national workforce in the private and public sectors. These skills can only be acquired in an active research environment. The WSU GeoAnalytical Lab contributes to this educational mission in four ways: (1) through formal course instruction and hands-on training of WSU graduate students from a variety of disciplines, (2) through undergraduate research projects that use the instrumentation, (3) through training of visiting students, and (4) through employment of part-time student labor, which introduces students to the skills and responsibility required to successfully perform laboratory procedures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding the establishment, evolution, and continued functioning of such processes requires knowledge of the planet?s thermal history, but much of that history remains unconstrained in part because several controlling mechanisms have yet to be quantified. As such, this award aims to study how Earth?s cooling rate may be altered through variable insulation of the planet?s interior by continents along the surface and large, continent-sized piles of anomalous material (Large Low Shear Velocity Provinces; LLSVPs) covering portions of the outer core. Previous studies separately examined the insulating effects of continents and LLSVPs, but none focused on the potentially counteracting effects of simultaneous insulating bodies: continents are predicted to increase the mantle?s internal temperature while LLSVPs decrease it. This study will quantify the resulting dynamic and thermal effects of such bodies and the implications for the Earth?s cooling history, plate tectonics, and magnetic field. Furthermore, both continents and LLSVPs act as chemical reservoirs that isolate critical elements from participating in global cycling for potentially long portions of Earth?s history. However, the formation and evolution of LLSVPs is still actively debated. This study will identify their likely thermal and chemical fingerprints as an additional means of testing their potential formation timing and duration. In addition to scientific advances, this project will expand educational opportunities centered on the deep Earth through an interdisciplinary game development program that will produce a new, widely distributed, educationally focused video game designed to combat several geoscience misconceptions while supporting a diverse, interdisciplinary group of ten undergraduate student developers. Finally, this award supports two graduate students and a post-doctoral scholar at two rural, land-grant universities, Washington State University and University of Idaho. <br/><br/>This award supports a novel study that will systematically evaluate how simultaneous surface and basal insulating bodies in Earth?s mantle (continents + LLSVPs) jointly alter the thermal evolution and internal mantle dynamics of the Earth. Two-dimensional spherical numerical simulations will be used to quantify the impacts of simulated LLSVP and continental materials in models of increasing rheological, thermal, and temporal complexity to address three research objectives: (1) isolate the fundamental processes governing interactions of surface (continent) and basal (LLSVP) insulators, (2) quantify the influence of complex rheology and internal heating on the basal and surface insulator convective system, and (3) examine impacts of time-evolving basal and surface insulators through Earth?s history. Numerical simulations of the Earth?s mantle subject to surface (continent) and basal (LLSVP) insulators will be conducted using the highly parallel finite-element code ASPECT (Advanced Solver for Problems in Earth?s ConvecTion). Simulations will be solved in parallel across ~32-256 computational cores on University of Idaho?s Falcon supercomputer (>33k cores, 1.17 Petaflop) or Washington State University?s Kamiak high performance computer cluster. For each of the ~200 planned simulations, the conservation equations will be discretized across a dynamically refined grid of ~2 million finite elements with enhanced element resolution near strong thermal and compositional gradients, allowing an accurate quantification of heat transfer through the model system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Researchers collaborate with teachers in six different high schools to develop new teaching materials that use geospatial technologies such as geographic information systems (GIS) and GPS-enabled iPads or other mobile devices. Students use these tools to investigate local social and/or environmental topics, such as the urban heat island effect, civic impacts of urban trees, or carbon costs of different transportation systems. Each investigation involves student data collection, data visualization, and analysis, combining both students' own data and data from other sources--such as local governments, federal agencies, or researchers. The investigation concludes with students proposing a change in their communities, such as adding or re-allocating urban greenspace or expanding bike trails or pedestrian access to bridges. Each investigation is aligned to local curriculum and standards. As students complete these investigations, they (a) learn about geospatial tools and careers, (b) develop spatial thinking and reasoning skills, and (c) become motivated to pursue STEM-related college and career paths. The teachers also enhance their skills, particularly their understanding and use of geospatial tools and data sets. This project increases the reach and the diversity of the STEM pipeline in geospatial fields directly--by working with approximately 1500 students across the 6 high schools--and indirectly--through the teacher training and professional development, continuing to impact students beyond the lifespan of the project.<br/><br/>This project extends the work of a previous ITEST award that established a model for the co-design, development, and implementation of local socio-environmental science investigations (SESI) using a geospatial curriculum. The learning activities provided opportunities for students to collaborate, seek evidence, problem-solve, master technology, develop geospatial thinking and reasoning (GTR) skills, and practice communication skills, all of which are essential for the STEM workforce. This project uses an adapted form of the original SESI model to work with a larger and more varied group of high school students across three different regions: urban areas in Delaware and Pennsylvania (Lehigh University), rural Washington state (Washington State University Tri-Cities), and urban Texas (Texas Christian University). At each of these sites, university faculty collaborate with two high schools to form a Research-Practice Partnership (RPP) to co-design, develop, and implement SESI activities embedded within the school?s regular curriculum. Student outcomes consist of geospatial thinking and reasoning skills (assessed via a performance task), STEM college and career interest (adapted career inventory), and spatial learning attitudes (adapted learning preferences questionnaire).

Samples with this unique property experience a dramatic increase in electrical conductivity when exposed to light, which persists long after the light is turned off. Strontium titanate, a transparent crystal, exhibits large persistent photoconductivity at room temperature, opening possibilities for industrial applications ranging from optical memory devices to electroplating of metals on surfaces. The research team is attempting to characterize the defects that are responsible for this unusual behavior, maximize the size of the effect, and discover it in new materials. They use state-of-the-art facilities to grow novel crystals and study their physical properties. Students involved in this research perform hands-on experiments, present results at international conferences, and meet with startup companies to discuss potential applications. In conjunction with the optical theme of the research, lessons are developed for a required course for elementary education students seeking the middle science credential.

The research team is attempting to achieve large, room temperature persistent photoconductivity in barium titanate, a ferroelectric material that could exhibit larger conductivity changes than those previously discovered in strontium titanate. This unique phenomenon is exploited to investigate electrical properties, over a well-defined range of carrier concentrations, to provide insight into scattering mechanisms and small-polaron versus free-electron transport. Using unique facilities at Washington State University, crystals are grown with high purity and controlled defect populations. These crystals include solid solutions (alloys) that are designed to have optimal properties. A variety of experimental methods, including Hall effect, infrared spectroscopy, and photoluminescence, are used to study the persistent photoconductivity and the defects responsible for it. Besides providing fundamental insight, establishing defect and transport properties is important because it will allow researchers to control (i.e., induce and erase) and optimize the effect.

Such atmospheric features have contributed to notable extreme events in the region, including the 2021 Northwest Heatwave, droughts, and the 2020 Labor Day Fires that burned across Oregon and Washington. While ridges are a normal part of the mid-latitude atmospheric circulation, their occurrence over western North America is influenced by multiple unique factors including proximity to the Pacific Ocean, interactions between the Pacific Ocean and the atmosphere and the complex topography of western North America. The overarching goal of this project is to advance our basic understanding of the components of the Earth system that influence atmospheric ridges over western North America, which could help identify sources for their seasonal to sub-seasonal predictions and investigate how and why ridges will respond to continued global warming. The project will target three key questions using a combination of observations and the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) climate model simulations: (1) How do various atmosphere, ocean and land-surface conditions influence characteristics of atmospheric ridges such as their extent, frequency, persistence and amplitude?  (2) How are simulated changes in ridge characteristics influenced by changes in these physical drivers? and (3) How do potential changes in ridge characteristics interact with warming to influence surface climate and extremes in the region?  In addition, detailed analyses of the physical mechanisms associated with extreme ridges (very large, very amplified, and/or very persistent ridges) will be conducted, as they are likely associated with the most significant climate impacts. Together, the proposed work will provide an understanding of the physical mechanisms associated with weather and climate extremes that are associated with major societal impacts, in current and future warmer climates.<br/><br/>The proposed work will advance the understanding of how and why natural climate variability and anthropogenic climate change influences this important atmospheric feature. Findings will facilitate the evaluation of implications of current and future weather and climate extremes that affect various sectors including human health, water resources, infrastructure, the regional economy, and emergency management resources. The outcomes of this work are directly translatable to impacts on society and the environment, thus aiding planning and adaptation measures. The proposed work will address gaps in scientific literature about how factors such as natural climate variability modes such as El Niño Southern Oscillation and anomalous soil-moisture conditions influence ridging in this region. The methods, framework, and insights developed from this work will be extensible to other mid-latitude regions. The project will involve training a postdoctoral researcher and a graduate student, who will be directly supported by the project, as well as undergraduate students from underrepresented backgrounds at Washington State University Vancouver (WSUV) and Portland State University (PSU). It will directly contribute to building STEM research infrastructure at WSUV, which is a primarily undergraduate institution with ~44% first-generation students, ~55% women and ~33% students of color. The investigators, postdoc, and graduate student will participate in the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry (OMSI) Science Communication Fellowship program that involves creating hands-on activities to demonstrate our research to the museum visitors and for the team's outreach efforts with local educators, schools, community groups and stakeholders.

Continuous monitoring of user activities and vital signs is exciting, as it can expose health issues otherwise difficult to perceive in an office visit. Indeed, wearable devices have been identified as a key technology to support the aging United States population by the White House National Science and Technology Council. Despite the impressive potential of wearable technology, its widespread adoption in clinical and everyday settings has been limited due to user comfort, usability, and energy sustainability challenges. This CAREER project proposes to resolve these challenges through three closely integrated research aims: 1) A wearable design kit to automatically design comfortable and usable wearable systems as a function of the user, clinician, and application requirements; 2) self-sustainable wearable devices through energy harvesting and management from ambient sources such as light, body motion, and heat; 3) algorithms and methods to enable reliable health applications for continuous health monitoring. The successful outcome of these objectives will help wearable devices achieve their full potential in transforming the quality of human life and healthcare. The project will also generate new knowledge and insights into the design of wearable systems and, more broadly, Internet of Things devices.<br/><br/>The widespread adoption of wearable devices enabled by this CAREER project will have two significant impacts on public health: (i) High-precision monitoring and management of diseases in free-living environments; and (ii) reduction in healthcare costs due to a reduced need for clinical visits. The integrated educational component of this CAREER project will train a strong and diverse multidisciplinary workforce to handle future challenges in computing system design and automation. One of the key educational goals of the project is to improve science and mathematics learning for children with disabilities to increase their participation in the science and technology workforce. The project also includes an ambassador program to involve students from community colleges in Washington to recruit underrepresented students into Washington State University (WSU) programs. Results from this CAREER project will be widely disseminated through publications in conferences, journals, and open-source packages for use by the community.

Research demonstrates that traditional teacher preparation programs continue to fall short in recruitment, preparation, and retention of secondary mathematics teacher candidates from communities that have not historically been well represented in the teaching profession. The project seeks to prepare graduates to enact culturally responsive teaching practices and to showcase mathematics as a human activity that can be applied to address issues of equity and social justice, such as income inequality, climate change, and racism. The project seeks to increase the diversity and number of secondary mathematics teachers who adopt human perspectives and practices to meet the needs of learners in high-need schools.<br/><br/>This project at Washington State University includes partnerships between the Colleges of Arts & Sciences and Education, two campuses (Pullman and Vancouver), two regional Educational Service Districts (ESDs), Washington State Mathematics Fellows as virtual mentors, and mentor teachers from nine high-need local school districts. Project goals include: (1) recruiting 24 undergraduate mathematics majors over three years to pursue teacher certification; and (2) preparing mathematics teachers who will persist in teaching and can effectively meet the needs of students in high-need school districts. The project features both an undergraduate (Pullman campus) and a graduate (Vancouver campus) pathway. Grounded in theoretical perspectives of mathematics and mathematics teaching as humanizing activities, project activities will promote asset-based perspectives of students, mathematics learning environments that intellectually challenge all students and foster positive mathematical identities, and the use of mathematics to connect to the community and to promote social justice. Institutional data, edTPA scores, surveys regarding critical thinking and diversity preparedness, course artifacts, and focus group interviews will to be used to generate understanding of how programs can inspire prospective mathematics teachers to embody core humanizing principles. Broadly, the project hopes to serve as a model for humanizing mathematics teacher preparation as it promotes policies and narratives in mathematics and mathematics teaching that serve the needs of individuals from backgrounds underrepresented in STEM fields. This Track 1: Scholarships and Stipends project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts.

Particularly notable are the many huge eruptions that produced the Columbia River Basalts (CRB) between 17 and 6 million years ago. The CRB lavas inundated Oregon and Washington, producing thick stacks of lava, in places of thousands of feet or more, and covering in excess of 150,000 square miles. Such voluminous lava outpourings are Earth?s biggest volcanic events and understanding them is key to understanding fundamental aspects of the dynamic behavior of our planet. Lavas of the CRB were fed from fissure eruptions similar to those observed today on Hawaii, Iceland, or at other areas with active basalt volcanism, but much much larger in scale. In recent years, it has become clear the magmas feeding such events can travel long distances laterally underground, instead of vertically from an underlying melt source prior to their eruption. This study will address whether CRB magmas travelled in the subsurface for long distances, and where the magma storage sites were located, to better understand where magmas from the deep Earth interior (> 40 km) ascended to the surface.<br/><br/>This study will combine geochronological, geochemical, and rock magnetic techniques to examine magma flow within Columbia River feeder dikes, and thus will test models of magma transport. Along-strike variations in the age, chemistry, and flow direction in the ~400 km-long Columbia River dike system will be examined to constrain regional-scale magma transport dynamics in the plumbing system of this Large Igneous Province (LIP). This multidisciplinary approach will provide the first dataset of magnetic flow for Columbia River LIP dikes and to supply new and critical constraints on the timing and dynamics of magma emplacement in the province, which are currently lacking. Key questions related to Columbia River LIP magmatism that can be addressed with the new data include: 1) Did Columbia River LIP magmas originate from the inferred inception position of the Yellowstone hotspot at the Nevada-Oregon border? 2) Were there discrete zones of magma storage, from which magma travelled laterally away to feed flood lavas? 3) Over what timescales were dike swarms emplaced, and did the site of magmatism progressively migrate northward away from the Yellowstone hotspot?

While research efforts aimed at the development of 3D hydrocarbon polymers have resulted in low-density covalent-organic and metal-organic frameworks, the synthesis of dense 3D hydrocarbon framework polymers with high strength and high chemical energy density has not been achieved.  These extended solids, when made of low Z elements, are intrinsically hard yet light, e.g., diamond and c-BN, and often exhibit superior thermal, mechanical, chemical, and electro-optical properties and constitute a new class of novel materials. With this project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research, Professor Choong-Shik Yoo and his research group at Washington State University (WSU) will investigate pressure-induced transformations of dense solid mixtures of first- and second-row elemental solids, aimed at development of dense extended framework materials (EFM) amenable to the stabilization at ambient conditions.  This research will provide exceptional education and training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students and postdoctoral researchers through significant hands-on experience in cutting-edge experimental technologies at WSU, large-science user facilities (APS, LCLS, XFEL), and DOE national laboratories (LLNL, LANL, SNL). The multidisciplinary nature of this project also provides students unique experience in working across many academic disciplines, often on large-scale high-profile research, with ample opportunities of enabling collaborations.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>Dense framework structures are ubiquitous at high pressures, but often formed at formidably high pressures and become unstable upon releasing the pressure.  As a result, only a few systems have been recovered at ambient conditions, limiting the materials at the realm of fundamental scientific discovery and advocating an exciting new research area to understand and, ultimately, control the stability, bonding, structure, and properties of low Z extended solids. This project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research, will use large compression, dense solid mixtures, and kinetic controlled processes to control the structure, bonding and stability of extended framework materials (EFM) made primarily of covalent C/H/N/O single bonds. The proposed research efforts will be focused on three-specific solid-state chemical reactions under pressures: (A) Copolymerization to stoichiometric high-strength EFM; (B) Redox chemistry to nonstoichiometric interstitial-filled multifunctional EFM; and (C) Interface chemistry to nm-scale EFM encapsulated in low-dimensional carbon and BN. Through scientific discoveries and innovative materials developments, the proposed research will exploit the structure-property-functional relationships of various forms of EFM, elucidate the basic principles governing dense solid-state chemistries, and demonstrate the revolutionary capabilities of multifunctional EFM sustainable to extreme mechanical, thermal and chemical conditions. The proposed research strategy involves application of a broad range of complimentary scientific approaches from solid-state materials chemistry, condensed matter physics, physical chemistry, materials science and engineering, thus achieving the impact well beyond the subject matter of this proposal.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Advancing fundamental knowledge about persistent optical effects could benefit technologies ranging from rewritable electronics to smart windows. When a semiconductor is exposed to light, electrons from the valence band or defect levels can be promoted to the conduction band, increasing electrical conductivity. In the dark, the system generally relaxes to the ground state and conductivity returns to normal. Persistent photoconductivity (PPC) occurs when the conductivity remains even after the light source is turned off. Related to PPC, photochromism is a change in color upon exposure to light. The researchers are testing the hypothesis that PPC and photochromism in oxide semiconductors arise from the same effect: light liberates a hydrogen impurity from its substitutional site, leaving behind an oxygen vacancy. Using unique facilities at Washington State University, crystals are grown with high purity and controlled defect populations.

Most fuel cell technologies, however, rely on hydrogen as the fuel and so the low energy density of compressed hydrogen gas and the large energy input needed to produce cryogenic liquid hydrogen limit every-day transportation applications of this hybrid electrical energy technology. Ethanol, a liquid under ambient conditions, constitutes a renewable and high energy density alternative to hydrogen, albeit with the drawback that the ethanol must be reformed to hydrogen in a complex chemical process before it can be fed to the fuel cell. In this proposal, the ethanol reforming process will be integrated with the fuel cell by developing a catalyst that accomplishes this chemical transformation on one of the fuel cell electrodes, eliminating the costly, heavy, and energy intensive reforming process. The academic researchers developing this direct-feed ethanol fuel cell will partner with Nissan North America, Inc. to advance their e-Bio Fuel-Cell automotive technology. If successful, the outcomes of this project include a total weight/cost reduction of the reformer/fuel cell system and a simplified fuel cell internal design. The proposed research builds on an existing collaboration between Nissan and the academic research team. This GOALI proposal will support this close link between the industrial and academic research teams through a student internship program, introducing graduate students to interdisciplinary research involving material synthesis, catalyst engineering, and fuel cell technology at Nissan, Washington State University (WSU), and Stony Brook University (SBU). The proposed work will have broad impact on (1) research experiences for underrepresented undergraduate students through the Office of Multicultural Student Services at WSU and the Inclusive Education program at SBU; (2) promoting public awareness of the importance of science and engineering by collaborating with the Palouse Discovery Science Center at WSU and the Institute for STEM Education at SBU; and (3) attracting high school students to the fields of science and engineering by mentoring a high school team for regional science events and participating in the ACS Project SEED Program. The results of the proposed research will be disseminated widely through the normal channels of publication and presentation at technical meetings.<br/><br/>In pursuit of practical direct-feed ethanol fuel cells that will enable long-distance electric transportation, the primary aims of this research program are to (1) develop ethanol reforming catalysts in the form of Mo-doped Ni (Ni-Mo) nanoparticles highly dispersed within a three-dimensionally ordered mesoporous BaO-based support that can strongly adsorb and activate H2O as the internal ethanol reforming layer over the conventional Ni-based fuel call anode, and (2) investigate the catalyst performance under conditions expected for transportation applications of direct-feed ethanol metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells (MS-SOFCs). A significant advantage of a direct-feed ethanol MS-SOFC is the simplicity afforded by not having to externally reform the ethanol fuel to hydrogen; however, under the harsh operating conditions of conventional MS-SOFC operation, the Ni-based anodes would quickly deactivate due to severe coking. To address this issue, the academic research team will design the multifunctional bilayer anode by electro-spraying Ni-Mo nanoparticles as the internal reforming layer over the anode surface. To successfully fabricate this bilayer anode, the PIs will first tune the electronic structure of Ni-Mo nanoparticle by controlling the Mo doping level and then infiltrate the nanoparticles into the high surface area, three-dimensionally ordered mesoporous BaZr0.4Ce0.4Y0.2O3 (BZCY) support. Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and environmental transmission electron microscopy (E-TEM) will be used to determine the oxidation state and structure of the Ni-Mo/BZCY catalysts under the nominal ethanol-reforming reaction conditions to relate those measurements to observed catalytic performance. The PIs will also use in-situ Raman and DRIFT spectroscopy to investigate the relationship between catalyst molecular structure and reforming reaction mechanisms. Based on the identified structure-activity relationships, the PIs will fabricate the high-performance Ni-Mo/BZCY internal reforming layer over the MS-SOFC anode and will use an in-situ Raman spectroelectrochemical system to investigate its internal reforming and overall electrochemical activity under actual SOFC operating conditions. Through the proposed Nissan North America, Inc. internship program, graduate students will work with Nissan engineers to evaluate and validate model MS-SOFCs with the internal reforming layer at Nissan under test conditions relevant to the vehicle operation. From these road profile tests, the power quality capability and performance of the direct-feed ethanol MS-SOFCs under a range of driving conditions will be assessed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Chemical processes such as chemical reactivity and detection sensitivity depend on cooperativity. Studying these cooperative interactions requires both surface techniques that are capable of single molecule detection and computational tools for quantifying the degree of interactions. Drs. Chilukuri, Hipps, and Mazur and their students will investigate how single molecules interact with one reactive site and how that system impacts beyond other nearby domains using both experimental and computational methods. The interplay among intermolecular, intramolecular, and substrate-induced effects on chemical reaction cooperativity at surfaces will be studied and analyzed. High school, graduate, and undergraduate students will be mentored in research, and an undergraduate course in nanoscale physical chemistry will be developed.<br/><br/>Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements reveal contributions of both inter- and intramolecular communications to cooperativity on the submolecular level while density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics provide a mechanism for quantifying the role of the substrate, inter and intramolecular interactions, spatial effects, and spin-spin interactions in producing cooperativity in axial complexation. Real-time STM imaging will be used to monitor the reaction between molecules in solution and/or the gas phase and reactive sites on surface supported metal complexes containing two or more reactive sites. Reactivity will be monitored as a function of temperature, reactant concentration, solvation environment, and nature of the support for the metal complexes. Several approaches will be used to model the STM experiments, including the grand canonical ensemble to parameterize the energetics of binding for each distribution over the reactive sites and periodic DFT calculations to provide insight into how electronic distributions affect binding cooperativity at reactive sites. Molecular dynamics calculations will be employed to model solvent effects. By developing a comprehensive model of reaction cooperativity at surfaces, improved predictability of reactivity in surface chemistry, catalysis, and sensor development is envisioned.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will develop lab units called Desktop Learning Modules, which are hands-on miniaturized equipment representing real  industrial processes. They are portable, can be used outside of class, and significantly assist students in learning about fluid mechanics and heat transfer, both of which are fundamental transport concepts in engineering. The goal of the project is to transform teaching and learning in foundational engineering courses through national dissemination of fluid mechanics and heat transfer Desktop Learning Modules. Training workshops and community development will be provided through five regional hubs to be established to help disseminate the Desktop Learning Module approach.<br/><br/>Prior use of hydraulics Desktop Learning Modules have shown that 70% of students achieved competency on concepts tested, on average, compared to 39% in control groups. Also, in fluid mechanics, participants have shown significant learning gains. In preliminary studies, the transferability of Desktop Learning Modules to other institutions has been demonstrated.  For example, after using a Desktop Learning Module, the University of Kentucky observed a 50-100% improvement in post-tests on topics such as hydraulic loss. In this project, a mixed methods research study will be used to test the hypothesis that definitive changes can occur in student learning and interest when Desktop Learning Modules are used in a team-oriented, hands-on learning environment. A faculty support framework will be used to foster changes in engagement with the novel pedagogy, thus enhancing instructor ease of adoption and implementation. It is expected that the project will have significant impact on the learning of difficult engineering concepts and increase diversity in engineering by accommodating of a range of student abilities and learning preferences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

During mountain building, rocks that were once deeply buried often become exhumed and transported to the Earth?s surface. This project will investigate a region of central Idaho that experienced an ancient collision between an ocean island system and the North American continent, which resulted in exhumation of rocks that were buried as deeply as 40 kilometers. This study will test whether a portion of the lower crust detached from the overlying tectonic plate and subsequently sank into the mantle below, causing the overlying rocks to be uplifted towards the surface, or alternatively whether movement along steep faults resulted in their exhumation. To evaluate these hypotheses, rock samples will be collected and evaluated to give information on when, and at what rates, these deep rocks were translated towards the surface. The results of this project will improve our understanding of the tectonic processes that are active during plate collisions and mountain building events, which can impact the distribution and quality of geologic resources. This project will improve STEM education by generating field-based learning and research opportunities for undergraduates and graduate students at Washington State and Missouri State universities. The results of this project will introduce STEM research to undergraduates each year through geology lectures. Grade-appropriate presentations will be developed for K-12 students to introduce them to their local geology and allow for the discussion of STEM careers.<br/><br/>Quantifying the contributions of processes that exhume deep-seated metamorphic rocks during collisional tectonics is fundamental for understanding how mountain belts evolve. In the North American Cordilleran orogen in central Idaho, the Salmon River suture zone is a ~30 kilometer-wide region that experienced Jurassic-Early Cretaceous contractional deformation associated with collision of a volcanic island arc terrane with the western edge of the North American continent. Rocks in the suture zone record structural burial to and subsequent exhumation from depths as great as 40 kilometers, and therefore are ideal for investigating the processes that drive high-magnitude exhumation during accretionary events. This project will test two primary hypotheses: 1) Rocks in the Salmon River suture zone were exhumed via hinged unroofing following lithospheric delamination, which predicts contemporaneous exhumation-related cooling across the width of the suture zone and eastward-increasing exhumation rates and magnitudes; or 2) Rocks in the Salmon River suture zone were exhumed via forward-breaking thrust propagation, which predicts a systematic westward younging of the timing of peak burial, initial exhumation, and motion on thrust faults. To test these hypotheses, this project will integrate structural analysis and geochronology of field relationships, the timing and pressure-temperature conditions of peak metamorphism, and multi-part temperature-time paths as a proxy for exhumation-related cooling. The results of this project will have implications for our understanding of the geodynamic processes that operate during accretionary events. In addition,  project results will address the existence, scale, and effects of lithospheric removal, and the temporal and spatial relationships between accretion-related burial and associated shortening and exhumation in the overlying middle and upper crust.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite their importance, many river systems are highly contaminated with toxins, sediment, nutrients, and metals. Contamination originates from many sources, including industrial activity, pesticide runoff, wastewater treatment discharges, and urban runoff. This contamination is considered an invisible water crisis posing serious risks for wildlife and human health in many places. As this crisis escalates in watersheds, it impacts the communities living in these watersheds adversely. Therefore, it becomes important to train a new workforce capable of integrating scientific information, public policy, and the knowledge and concerns of affected social groups, including Native American tribes, for effective management of the resources of river systems. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to the Washington State University will train graduate students from across the United States how to study challenges in rivers, watersheds, and communities as they relate to human and ecosystem health and will use the Columbia River Basin as the study site. The project anticipates training 65 master?s and doctoral degree students, including 25 funded trainees, from civil and environmental engineering, biological sciences, environmental and natural resources sciences, environmental sociology, and political science. Central to the traineeship is developing a community engagement approach that begins with the recognition that communities face diverse and complex issues and leverages knowledge of native communities to identify key problems and implement equitable solutions. Students participating in this program will engage with communities to co-produce solutions and opportunities to the invisible water crisis through scientific training, research, and problem-solving. <br/><br/>This NRT program will integrate the natural sciences, engineering, social sciences, and traditional knowledges to develop a transdisciplinary research program in river-watershed-community systems that ultimately will produce equitable solutions to pressing, societal problems experienced by diverse communities. Program activities are focused on two education and training objectives aimed to: (1) cause a cultural shift in STEM graduate education by embracing transdisciplinary learning and the co-production of knowledge through community engagement, and (2) transform our STEM graduate training into a student-centered mentoring model. Education and research themes address basic and applied research questions related to water quality and landscape dynamics of river systems, anthropogenic changes in the environment that affect ecosystem health, and equitable mitigation of the cultural, economic, or health consequences experienced by communities. The traineeship program gives students the flexibility to pursue individualized research paths and provides hands-on training experiences to build skill and competency in communication, teamwork, ethics, cultural knowledge, traditional knowledges, transdisciplinarity, and quantitative/computational research methods. Program elements weave engagement experiences throughout the student experience in the form of novel courses, leadership training, a Columbia River Basin Living Atlas focused on data integration and visualization, and multi-media communication. The student-centered mentoring model includes a trainee development plan, external mentoring, and faculty development. Program elements will be institutionalized in the form of a Science and Community Engagement (ScienCE) certificate available to all STEM students.<br/><br/>The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training. The program is dedicated to effective training of STEM graduate students in high priority interdisciplinary or convergent research areas through comprehensive traineeship models that are innovative, evidence-based, and aligned with changing workforce and research needs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An SGRB is one of the most energetic explosions in the cosmos and is triggered by the collision of two neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole. It is accompanied by the emission of electromagnetic radiation across a wide range of wavelengths, as well as gravitational waves. While the prototypical binary neutron star collision, GW170817, expanded our understanding of such bursts in unprecedented ways, it also left certain questions unresolved. One such question is the fate of these collisions, which have been conjectured to affect the afterglows of SGRBs. This work will support multi-messenger astronomical observations of SGRB counterparts of gravitational wave (GW) signals in LIGO and Virgo to understand the nature of the remnants produced by them. The project will involve citizen scientists in this investigation via the development of Machine Learning tools for distinguishing noise artifacts in GW detectors that can masquerade as GW signals from these collisions. It will also contribute to training students at the Tri-Cities campus of the Washington State University and education and public outreach activities in neighboring areas. This campus is close to the LIGO-Hanford site and caters to a large percentage of Hispanic and Native-American populations. <br/><br/>This project will enhance the science exploitation of gravitational-wave observations with LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA during their fourth and fifth observation runs. It will reduce the number of false alarms among the low-latency alerts issued by those detectors. For this purpose, it will specifically target GW signals from binaries involving neutron stars. This aids astronomical observatories that follow-up these GW alerts in their quest for detecting accompanying electromagnetic and particle emissions. The project will pursue this objective by (a) contributing to the more complete accounting of sources of non-Gaussian transient noise, (b) identifying different types of non-linear couplings of noise sources, and (c) improving the significance measurement of online GW alerts by utilizing Machine Learning solutions and automated data quality inputs. It will also develop signal-based noise discriminators, or ?chi-square? tests, for targeting especially those noise artifacts that are responsible for a majority of false alerts. Observations of these binaries will be used to improve our understanding of the neutron star equation of state and gravitational-wave aided measurements of the Hubble constant.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The interdisciplinary IRES research experiences in Germany will also train the scholars on the initiation, establishment, and cultivation of scientific collaborations, which will benefit them in their professional careers, make them more marketable for research occupations both domestically and internationally, and sustain regional and national economies with multinational corporations in the agricultural industries. <br/><br/>The NSF-IRES venture between WSU and the German Institutions within the CEPLAS program has resulted from a strategic research and education partnership between the two institutions. The CEPLAS cluster includes the Universities of Cologne and Düsseldorf, and the Max Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research, which are world-class research centers. The IRES scholars will work on research projects that revolve on a deeper understanding of complex plant traits. The knowledge gained by this fundamental research has high agronomic relevance that can help to improve the yield and adaptation of crop plants to limited natural resources and pave the way for bioengineering crop plants that are more productive and robust against environmental challenges.

Investigations of plankhouses will therefore provide foundational data for understanding how small-scale societies can effectively organize economics, people and resources in ways that promote sustainability and resilience at the local level. The study of Northwest Coast lifeways, with its emphasis on local management of resources and decentralized decision making, can reveal potentially new strategies and options for reshaping current social practices towards greater sustainability. Archaeology is particularly suited to address these goals because it considers a range of societies with multiple different organizational principles.

However, several recent failures of water infrastructure that we rely on for this safety have highlighted the need to better understand and monitor the Nation's water quality. Recent research has shown that water quality can deteriorate from the source at the drinking water treatment plant to the taps in homes. A focus of this research is on in-building ""premise plumbing"", the least understood and monitored part of the water distribution system. Premise plumbing has the highest surface-to-volume ratios in the distribution system, making it susceptible to pipe surface chemical and biological reactions. In addition, water can often sit stagnant in small pipes for days, resulting in loss of residual disinfectant activity and resulting pathogen growth in pipe surface biofilms. This project will determine how to reduce the decay of disinfectant, the formation of toxic disinfectant byproducts, and the growth of pathogens in biofilms that grow on premise plumbing surfaces. This will be achieved by controlled experiments with disinfectants and molecular level characterization of the microbes present in the biofilm. Results will be shared with the drinking water industry, water regulators, and other stakeholders to develop best management practices for ensuring the safety of home drinking water.<br/><br/>A systematic study is proposed to understand how, when, and where risk occurs in premise plumbing. The research is based on the following hypotheses: (H1) drinking water chemical constituents control the porous structure of premise plumbing biofilms; (H2) these biofilm properties control the mass exchange of disinfectant between the biofilm and bulk aqueous phases and consequently the residual concentrations of disinfectants; and (H3) laboratory biofilms grown in the presence of drinking water will have diffusion and reaction properties of biofilms occurring in premise plumbing networks supplied from those sources. A collaborative research program will test these hypotheses through a multi-stage research program. First, biomass growth under stagnant conditions with depleted disinfectant concentrations on PEX and PVC, common premise plumbing materials using tap water amended with anti-scaling and/or anti-corrosion chemicals to simulate treated drinking water. H1 will be tested by analyzing 3D porous structure of biofilm matrix based on optical coherence tomography of biofilms grown from these different waters. H2 will be tested by quantifying the interaction of disinfectant with biofilm via coupon- and pipe-section scale reactive transport experiments and modeling. H3 will be tested by quantifying free chlorine decay and formation of disinfectant byproducts in building scale experiments at the University of Illinois and Washington State University under different stagnation times.

However, the formation of these supermassive black holes and the methods by which they grow remain uncertain. While astronomers cannot observe the black holes directly, light from gas or stars falling onto the black holes will produce bright disks of accretion that can be. In this program, the PIs will study time-variable signatures from these systems to provide unique constraints on the properties and environments of black holes in the centers of galaxies. This work will address fundamental questions about formation and evolution of supermassive black holes. The investigators will also develop a set of inquiry-based educational materials for high school students. These materials will convey excitement about supermassive black holes while addressing common misconceptions about extreme gravity. The activities will map to the key scientific practices identified by the Next-generation State Standards used by both Illinois and Washington and provide students an opportunity to engage in exploration and discussion. <br/><br/>Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are ubiquitous in the centers of massive galaxies, yet the formation of SMBH progenitors and their routes of growth remain unclear. The properties of SMBHs can be revealed by the accretion of gas or tidally-disrupted stars. Variable or transient emission from these phenomena provide constraints on the masses, accretion disk properties, and small-scale environments of these SMBHs. The study will (1) identify intermediate mass black holes in order to understand possible routes for SMBH formation, and (2) constrain the environments of active and quiescent SMBHs to understand how SMBHs grow and how they co-evolve with their host galaxies. This work will use observations from the Young Supernova Experiment -- a repeat imaging survey using the Pan-STARRS telescopes to image 1500 square degrees of sky in four bands with a three day cadence. They will search for active and quiescent SMBHs in low-mass galaxies through variability and tidal disruption events, respectively. They will identify and characterize changing-state AGN, use continuum reverberation mapping to study accretion disk properties, and study the broader population of tidal disruption events observed by the Young Supernova Experiment. This project will also study the environments and host galaxy properties of active and quiescent SMBHs as they grow and evolve, which will inform studies of galaxy--SMBH co-evolution and provide predictions for future work with the Vera C.

The aim is to expand applicability and to enhance the quality of results, comparable to the improvements derived from the conversion of telephones from analog to digital.  The project focuses on a type of instrument called a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer that is routinely used in hospitals and medical laboratories to perform diagnostic tests.  The digital conversion seeks to expand the number and types of tests that can be performed by enhancing the instrument?s speed, resolution, mass range, and sensitivity.  Beyond the important scientific goals of this proposal, the training of highly skilled instrumentation scientists is an emerging national need that will be addressed by this effort and the collaborations that will result. <br/><br/>The Reilly group has invented a new digital waveform generation method that they recently used to develop a digital mass filter.  Relative to a conventional analog analyzer (i.e., sine), the digital filter can operate in higher stability zones without loss of mass range, providing significantly better sensitivity, resolution, and speed of analysis compared to commercial counterparts.  They are now using the digital waveform technology to create a digital triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (DQ3MS) both to outperform commercial instruments (Q3MS) both by improving performance at m/z (mass:charge ratio) < 3000 (accessible by Q3MS) and extending the accessible m/z range.  This should substantially expand the range and types of biological molecules that can be analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). The development of instrumentation with increased mass range is needed to directly and rapidly measure and quantify the distribution of expressed proteins, analyze complexes and their interactions. Digitally driven mass spectrometers are expected to increase the rate of discovery in the biology-based sciences. The anticipated benefits arising from the proposed work include: 1) training and education of future scientists in the area of analytical chemistry and biological mass spectrometry, 2) changing the paradigm for analyzing biological molecules and particles by mass spectrometry, and 3) establishing the area of analytical biology by rapidly quantifying biomolecules, their interactions and processes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By some estimates, nearly half of all occupations are at risk of being automated within the next two decades. At the same time, labor shortages within the U.S. have compromised post-pandemic recovery efforts and are particularly pronounced in occupational environments with high health and safety risks. Next-generation robots can address these challenges in industrial settings where the direct involvement of humans is either extremely hazardous, undesirable, or simply not feasible due to inherent barriers that limit accessibility. Educational programs are needed to provide scientists with both the technical knowledge for developing design solutions and the ethical understanding of issues related to deploying robotic technology responsibly to complement the skills of future workers. To address this need, this National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to the Washington State University (WSU) will establish a multi-disciplinary approach to training future robotics scientists, practitioners, and entrepreneurs in the design, implementation, and implications of robotics applications within agricultural, nuclear, and underwater settings. The project will train 52 graduate students, including 21 NRT-funded trainees in Biological Systems Engineering, Psychology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Materials Science & Engineering.<br/><br/>Through convergent problem-based learning in leadership, entrepreneurship, and applied psychology coupled with a cutting-edge technical foundation in robotics and autonomous systems, this NRT program will produce leaders in interdisciplinary research and scholarship who are trained to evaluate the psychosocial implications of next-generation robotic technology for future workers. These objectives will be accomplished via: (i) multi-disciplinary research in the areas of: soft-, micro-, and bio-robots; autonomous systems; flexible electronics; biomimetic devices; and human-robot collaboration; (ii) professional skills training in the areas of entrepreneurship, leadership, supervised teaching, and the psychosocial impacts of next-generation robotic technology on affected employee populations; (iii) technical skills training via coursework, cross-disciplinary seminars, conference attendance, and biweekly research team meetings; and (iv) sustained community engagement by means of site visits, trainee internships, undergraduate mentoring, and an annual research workshop and exposition.

Upcycling discarded plastics into high-value products could result in economic savings of billions of dollars and minimize negative environmental impact. However, municipal plastic waste streams are a mixture of various incompatible polymers such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinylchloride, polyethylene terephthalate, and polystyrene, as well as polymer additives, dyes, and contaminants. As a result, recovering high-quality plastic materials from mixed solid municipal wastes by physical sorting is a challenge. Thermochemical recycling of waste plastics is not economical since the current processes require intensive energy inputs and costly product upgrading. Therefore, energy-efficient catalytic deconstruction processes are needed to overcome the chemical and physical challenges of recycling mixed plastics. This project will develop an innovative waste plastics chemical upcycling process that selectively converts co-mingled waste plastics to valuable monomers and chemicals. It aims to promote a plastics circular economy and mitigate the negative environmental impact caused by accumulated plastic wastes. Education and outreach activities will be integrated with the research program to facilitate student and workforce development and encourage the participation of students from underrepresented groups in STEM.<br/><br/>The proposed waste plastics deconstruction approach is centered around the sequential catalytic solvolysis (SeCatSol) process. The SeCatSol process is a novel technology being developed at Washington State University for the selective stage-by-stage deconstruction of an individual polymer or classes of polymers in a polymer mixture using robust organocatalysts and heterogeneous catalysts under mild conditions. The SeCatSol process is designed to address the grand challenge in the plastic industry: how to deconstruct co-mingled municipal waste plastics selectively. The SeCatSol process sequentially produces monomers or value-added chemical products in each catalytic conversion unit, providing a feasible ?Chemical Sorting? method to upcycle the complex municipal plastic mixtures at a molecular level. A systematic team effort aims at developing highly selective catalysts and efficient solvents for the SeCatSol process. In particular, the advanced in-situ and operando characterization tools, such as NMR, ATR-FTIR, and Raman spectroscopy, will decipher the complexity of deconstructing waste plastics. Furthermore, novel predictive molecular computational methods will accelerate catalyst design and solvent selection. The proposed technology framework fits into a circular economic model that is restorative and regenerative by design.

Metal-organic frameworks are made by linking metal ions with organic molecules to form structures that can be one, two, or three-dimensional in nature. Such structures can be considered as microscopic scaffolds with holes or pockets. These pockets can be up to 90% of the volume of the structures, which means they are highly porous like a sponge. Traditional methods have struggled to create these structures with specific mixed metal species, but this new transmutation approach could be the key to overcoming this significant limitation. If successful, the materials resulting from this approach are expected to have unique properties that could potentially bring significant advances to various fields such as sensor technology, catalyst development, and materials that can absorb specific substances. A vital aspect of this project is the investigation into how these materials behave under extreme conditions. This knowledge could help in creating materials that can withstand harsh environments such as outer space, or that can improve nuclear waste management. The project will offer unique opportunities for students, particularly those from underrepresented groups, to get hands-on training and experience in porous materials synthesis and nuclear reactor operation under the guidance of Drs. Zhang and Heiden.<br/><br/>The funded research aims to apply nuclear transmutation within metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) to introduce secondary metal centers and study their stability under neutron irradiation. The resilience of these new materials under neutron radiation will be rigorously assessed based on their elemental composition, structure, and neutron dose. The level of activated isotopes, which is determined by the neutron dosage, can be controlled by adjusting the neutron irradiation flux while monitoring decay processes. The anticipated consequence of incorporating these secondary metal centers into the MOF structure is a significant alteration in both the stability and electronic properties of the target MOFs. For instance, the introduction of chromium into vanadium MOFs is expected to enhance material stability. The formation of chromium within vanadium MOFs is also expected to alter the  electronic properties of the MOF, as the size, acidity and redox chemistry of Cr ions are different from those of the V ions. The project will probe the coordination chemistry and structural dynamics of these materials under neutron flux. This high risk/high potential reward project has the potential to uncover innovative methodologies for developing advanced materials with enhanced properties and functionalities, thereby potentially making a significant contribution to the field of materials science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To meet the rising demand of an increasing human population for plant oils will require increased oil production and optimization of plant oil fatty acid compositions for societal applications. Current knowledge indicates that plant oil biosynthesis overlaps with essential membrane lipid production required for cellular function. This research is elucidating how plants balance accumulation of oil with synthesis of membrane lipids so that crop breeding and plant bioengineering efforts can optimize plant oil production without affecting the properties of biological membranes. The project uses genetic mutants, overexpression lines, protein localization and dynamic interactions, in vivo isotopic labeling, and mathematical modeling of non-stationary flux to produce a quantitative description of lipid metabolic network function and dynamics. New engineering strategies based on project results may provide alternative sources of nutritionally valuable food oils, or chemically reactive lipids that can functionally replace petroleum in chemical syntheses. Project results could also lead to the development of new value-added crops that can reinvigorate low-income rural farming communities. This project collaborates with the EXploring College Emerging Leaders (EXCEL) program at Washington State University that seeks to increase participation of Native American communities in STEM subjects. The three postdoctoral scientists, one post bachelor researcher, and multiple undergraduate students are being trained in scientific research and outreach to become the next generation of scientific leaders who will face future scientific challenges and enhance agricultural output for societal gain. <br/><br/>Valuable plant oils and essential membrane lipids are assembled by an overlapping metabolic network. The path of fatty acid flux through the network ultimately determines the final oil fatty acid composition, yet how plants control fatty acid flux through this network of lipid assembly is unknown. An important particular unknown is how plants control the use of key intermediates (diacylglycerol) between membrane and oil biosynthesis. This research leverages the expertise of a multi-disciplinary team to elucidate lipid metabolic network structure, fluxes, and sub-cellular spatial organization. A combination of genetic mutants, over-expression lines, protein localization and dynamic interactions, in vivo isotopic labeling, and mathematical modeling is used to develop a quantitative description of lipid metabolic network function and dynamics. This quantitative picture includes the cellular organization and the enzymatic control of fatty acid flux through different branches of the lipid metabolic network that affect seed oil accumulation and composition. The knowledge gained will result in a paradigm shift beyond the current network descriptions of static metabolites that have previously been used to develop bioengineering strategies. In vivo isotopic labeling-based metabolic flux maps enhance the quantitative and dynamic understanding of lipid network function and enable improved engineering efforts. The project also provides important new tools to help guide the design of better metabolic engineering (or targeted breeding) strategies to meet the plant oil needs of the future.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While genetically engineered crop genes can give helpful traits like pesticide resistance to crops, some can also be harmful if they are released in the environment. Antibiotic resistance genes (?ARGs?) and silencing RNA genes are two examples of genes that are potentially harmful. ARGs can increase the number of antibiotic resistant bacteria in the environment, which is a threat to public health. Silencing RNA genes can affect the genetic material of other organisms and the behavior of these genes in the environment is not well understood. Persistent pollutants like microplastics have been shown to make these genes more stable in the environment, making it more likely that they can be transported widely and negatively affect beneficial organisms. The goal of this research is to assess the transport, persistence, and uptake of ARGs and silencing RNA genes that are attached to microplastics in the environment. Understanding how genetically engineered crop genes behave in the environment is important for many fields including agriculture, medicine, and water treatment. The results have strong potential to advance knowledge and benefit society through the development of risk-based management policies to protect health by minimizing the spread of harmful genes. <br/><br/>The use of genetically engineered (GE) crops has remained controversial due to uncertainty regarding the ultimate fate and potential impacts the engineered genes can have on the surrounding environment. Common transgenes contained in modern GE crops include ARGs and silencing RNAs that have recently been detected in wastewater treatment plants and other environments. These findings are concerning because transgene contributions to global antibiotic resistance and their potential impacts to gene expression in environmental microbes are highly uncertain. Transgenes have also recently been shown to adsorb to the surfaces of micro- and nano-scale plastics (?MNPs?) that are frequently found in wastewater treatment plants and soils, suggesting their transport potential and resistance to degradation in the environment may be greater than currently estimated. The goal of this research is to understand how MNPs impact the transport of GEs in the environment. This goal will be achieved using a combined modeling and experimental approach to: i) Quantify transgene adsorption kinetics to MNPs, soils, and wastewater biosolids; ii) Assess the effects of key environmental factors on the persistence and uptake of GE transgenes; and iii) Evaluate transgene transport and transformation of model soil bacteria in agricultural soils. Successful completion of this research directly addresses important research gaps concerning transgene adsorption to MNPs, their behavior in the environment, and translation of experimental data to modeling frameworks that can be utilized by diverse stakeholder groups. Benefits to society result from interdisciplinary research training for graduate and undergraduate students to improve the Nation?s STEM workforce.

Using laser cooling and related techniques, a cloud of atoms is cooled down to temperatures near absolute zero. Under appropriate conditions the atoms coalesce into a Bose-Einstein condensate, a macroscopic matter wave displaying quantum mechanical behavior. The large size of these objects, which can extend over hundreds of microns, implies that they are readily observable using custom imaging optics, and a rich toolset based on atomic physics is available for their manipulation. This, together with their quantum mechanical nature, makes them an ideal platform to study complex quantum mechanical phenomena. With the recent and ongoing development of novel experimental tools and theoretical approaches, such quantum analog modeling has become a major thrust of research in Atomic, Molecular and Optical (AMO) physics. Ultracold atom platforms can be applied to study phenomena from condensed matter physics, nonlinear science, hydrodynamics, quantum optics, and more, demonstrating their importance as highly versatile testbeds in modern physics. The experiments conducted in this project investigate several approaches to probe the emergence of periodic structures with crystal-like properties from the macroscopic matter wave of a Bose-Einstein condensate. The dynamical properties of such crystalline structures pose many theoretical challenges, and the experiments provide essential benchmark data for the development of a theoretical understanding. Going beyond the realm of ultracold atoms, the insight gained through this line of research is of high relevance for condensed matter physics and nonlinear science as well. The experiments are conducted with complex setups that utilize a large range of modern experimental techniques, including lasers and optics, ultrahigh vacuum technology, automation programming, and advanced electronics. This makes them ideal platforms to train students in a multitude of areas relevant for modern quantum technologies which use quantum mechanical effects in sensor applications e.g. to detect magnetic, electric or gravitational fields, for fundamentally secure communication, or to establish new paradigms for efficient computing.   <br/> <br/><br/>This research program advocates the use of ultracold atomic gases as a highly flexible platform for the study of quantum phases and dynamics. Along the lines of quantum analog simulation, several innovative approaches to investigate emerging band structures and associated phenomena in dilute-gas Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) are employed. The starting point is a BEC in which spin and motional degrees of freedom are coupled by a set of Raman laser beams. This spin-orbit coupling is then supplemented with a radiofrequency dressing or microwave dressing to generate effective lattice structures with unusual properties. In the first case, an effective Zeeman lattice emerges even though neither the spin-orbit coupling nor the radiofrequency alone produce a periodic band structure. The second case leads to a new method to generate a supersolid-like state with large spatial periodicity, overcoming the limitations of previous approaches. As a third, complementary approach coming from a quantum hydrodynamics perspective, the experimental realization of densely packed interacting soliton trains provides a very different and unexplored access to the study of crystalline properties that arise in a superfluid system without imposing a periodic external potential.  The quantum analog simulation of condensed matter, hydrodynamic or nonlinear phenomena using the versatile toolbox of atomic physics is a highly active area in quantum gas research, and the experiments provide important benchmark data motivating the concurrent development of theoretical approaches.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An important element for understanding the operation of plate tectonics is documenting the magnitude of deformation of rocks that has occurred at and near the boundaries of plates. However, rocks that have been deformed at high temperatures and deep within the crust often do not preserve geologic features that allow measuring the magnitude of deformation. To address this issue, and thereby better characterize the rock deformation processes that operate at plate boundaries, recent research has proposed that measuring the degree (or ?intensity?) of alignment of the mineral quartz within rock samples can be used to delineate areas of relatively high- or low-magnitude deformation within the crust. This represents a promising new technique for understanding the spatial patterns of deformation. However, the intensity of alignment of quartz has not been directly correlated to the magnitude of deformation. The goal of this project is to generate an equation that relates the intensity of alignment of quartz to the magnitude of deformation. To accomplish this goal, we will document quartz intensity patterns and measure the magnitude of deformation associated with each intensity pattern in quartz-rich rocks in the Snake Range in Nevada. These rocks are ideal for this study because they have yielded well-defined intensity patterns in past studies, they preserve features that allow measuring the magnitude of deformation, and they exhibit a change from low-magnitude deformation in the western part of the range to high-magnitude deformation in the east. By collecting intensity and deformation magnitude measurements across the range, an equation relating these two parameters will be generated, which can then be applied globally to understand deformation magnitudes in any region that contains rocks deformed at high temperatures. This project will provide research projects for graduate and undergraduate students, thereby training the next generation of geoscientists. This project will also contribute to STEM education by presenting results in introductory geology courses that will reach 1,500 college students each year, giving talks at Great Basin National Park and at community colleges in eastern Washington and northern Idaho, and through a field trip for undergraduate students from both participating universities.<br/><br/>Understanding how and where strain becomes localized during deformation is fundamental for illuminating the processes that thicken, thin, or accommodate strike-slip shearing within continental crust during tectonism. Researchers have proposed that statistical intensity parameters calculated from quartz crystallographic fabrics have the potential to delineate zones of high strain, by interpreting fabric intensity as a proxy for finite strain magnitude. Several recent studies in the Himalaya have successfully utilized intensity parameters such as cylindricity to elucidate the spatial patterns of relative strain magnitude across major shear zones. However, as these studies were performed within packages of pervasively recrystallized rocks that lack deformed markers from which finite strain can be measured, they cannot quantitatively relate fabric intensity to absolute strain magnitude. We propose that generating a calibration equation that expresses fabric intensity as a function of finite strain magnitude would be a critical step forward for expanding the utility of this new approach. In this project, we propose to perform such a calibration by investigating rocks exposed within a Cenozoic extensional shear zone in the Northern Snake Range metamorphic core complex in Nevada. This field locality is ideal because the shear zone contains a quartzite unit that yields well-developed crystallographic fabrics, preserves micro-, meso- and regional-scale strain markers, and exhibits a dramatic across-strike gradient in finite strain magnitude. We propose to obtain cylindricity values from quartzite samples collected along a 30 km-long across-strike transect, and to use micro- and meso-scale strain analyses to generate a detailed model of 3-dimensional finite strain of this quartzite unit across this transect. Integration of these two datasets will allow calculation of a calibration equation that expresses fabric intensity as a function of finite strain magnitude, which will provide an indispensable new tool with which to approach the kinematic and structural analysis of ductile deformation. The results of this project will have far-reaching implications, as we propose to test the veracity of a technique that can then be applied globally within any contractional, extensional, or strike-slip orogenic system, active or ancient. The calibration between cylindricity and finite strain magnitude can be applied as a benchmark within any orogen that contains quartz-rich tectonites, in order to illuminate the spatial patterns of strain localization within shear zones that exhibit ubiquitous recrystallization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A major archaeological question is how local communities experienced and adapted to the rise and fall of regional state systems through the renegotiation of power, territory, and group identity. In this doctoral dissertation proposal researchers  investigate this topic through a bioarchaeological study of one set of regional mortuary assemblages. These date between the fall of one regional empire and the rise of another. The study investigates the strategies and mechanisms the society used to either consolidate power and integrate communities during times of state expansion, or develop smaller-scale local and regional systems, and renegotiate territory and group identity during periods of state decline. The archaeological work is also significant to the contemporary regional population who retain strong cultural connections to the prehistoric group and claim them as local ancestors. The research thus contributes to community efforts to promote, protect, and preserve cultural patrimony. <br/><br/>Through combined genetic, isotopic, and osteological analyses the researchers reconstruct aspects of kinship, community composition, migration, and group identity to understand the nature of the community and how it was impacted by the later rise of the Inca empire. Bioarchaeological analyses provide fine-grained perspectives on community and social group composition, and the lived experiences of past individuals. Strontium (87Sr/86Sr) and oxygen (?18O) isotope analyses document past migration to determine how population movements contributed to the formation of the society, and whether later Inca influence involved extensive population relocation. Ancient DNA (aDNA) analyses reconstruct the nature of biological relatedness within and between local communities to determine the extent to which communities were interconnected via kinship. Genetic analysis also reveal whether first generation migrants associated with Inca imperial expansion were having children with local individuals, which would provide evidence of interwoven kinship networks. Finally, observations of cranial vault modification are integrated with the isotopic and genetic data to determine how this visible trait was used to communicate and display aspects of social status, kinship, or identity in the region. By integrating multiple lines of complementary evidence for how  communities formed, interacted, and defined themselves, the research reconstructs how past communities and individuals experienced the effects of socio-political change.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This novel technology has the potential to revolutionize diverse STEM fields, with applications such as intelligent medicine and nanofabrication. However, current DNA computer circuits have several key limitations. Most existing circuits have only enough energy to complete one round of computation. Additionally, current DNA circuits are hardcoded to perform a single task. Developing each new program requires constructing an entirely new circuit, which can take years. This project aims to address these limitations by developing a robust, high-power, easily programable, universal DNA computer to execute any task. Additionally, this project aims to integrate research with education to help grow the field of DNA computing. In this regard, the first comprehensive textbook in molecular programming will be produced to attract new researchers and pilot coursework at partner universities will be created for students to learn about molecular programming. A bridge for early career researchers will also be built to transfer chemical computing technology from academia to industry, fostering a more diverse, creative, and innovative engineering workforce. <br/><br/>This project focuses on creating: (1) A robust DNA circuit, capable of running extremely high concentration reactions with reduced off-target activity; (2) High-energy DNA circuits with a chemical power supply capable of sustaining up to a hundred cycles of chemical computation; (3) Sequential DNA logic circuits; and (4) A universal DNA computer capable of executing software instructions stored in chemical memory, while the underlying chemical hardware can remain constant. The project represents a paradigm shift in chemical computing, enabling construction of DNA circuits with sustained dynamics while simplifying programming by separating the tasks of designing chemical hardware from writing chemical software. Successful completion of this project will enable novel research areas in high-concentration DNA computing, including construction of fundamental circuits such as flip-flops, robust oscillators, and universal stored-program hardware, dramatically simplifying the task of programming DNA computers and building towards programmable matter.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

According to this theory, atoms have both a particle-like and a wave-like nature at the same time, which gives rise to behaviors that do not seem intuitive based on ordinary experience in everyday life. This project consists of a line of research using tailored laser and radio-frequency fields to investigate inherently quantum mechanical phenomena including unusual states of matter, the role of interatomic interactions in precision measurement schemes, and a new paradigm for modelling general quantum systems using ultracold atoms. This project will promote the progress of science and technology by providing insight into intricate quantum mechanical effects in a well-controlled environment that involves quantum complexities while remaining simple enough to be amenable to the development of new mathematical descriptions. Since quantum mechanical behavior becomes dominant not only in the realm of ultracold temperatures but also in the realm of very small dimensions, the knowledge acquired through this project will also provide impetus for the development of next generation nanoelectronics devices, for precision measurement or for quantum information.  <br/> <br/>This project uses dilute-gas Bose-Einstein condensates formed by cooling rubidium atoms to temperatures near zero Kelvin. The atoms in the condensate form a macroscopic quantum system that can be manipulated and probed in very flexible ways. The project consists of a series of steps: First, by employing a suitably tailored light field comprised of the superposition of a Raman coupling field and an optical lattice, the excitation spectrum of a supersolid-like state will be studied that the Principal Investigator has recently realized in the lab. Second, a set of precision measurements will investigate the role of interaction effects in Raman dressing schemes and radio-frequency coupling schemes within the context of atom interferometry. This will illuminate the importance of interactions for quantum analog simulations. A clear cut demonstration of these interaction effects will be provided in the context of a spin tensor-momentum coupling scheme that leads to a variety of novel quantum phases. Finally, a new paradigm for quantum analog simulation will be experimentally realized by exploiting the parameter space of coupled internal states.

These devices could revolutionize how we interface with technology, transform our ability to renewably harvest and store energy, and advance healthcare. Printed solar panels have great potential, yet current technology still uses relatively low-performance materials or involves toxic lead-based materials. Organic solar cells require two different types of molecules to generate and transport charge from incident light. A recent breakthrough in the performance of organic solar cells uses a blend of three types of molecules. This suggests an opportunity for the next leap in a disruptive technology, but it is held back by a lack of scientific understanding of the phenomenon. Investigators will use X-ray probes to correlate the performance and nanostructure of these blends. They will also analyze charge generation dynamics to determine the processes responsible for performance gains. This work will reveal how to control the phenomenon to enable truly high-performance printed and lead-free photovoltaic modules to fully compete in the marketplace. Graduate students involved will benefit from the multidisciplinary nature of the work to gain critical experience and expertise in communicating in diverse collaborations. Their travel to major national laboratories for the work will provide new career opportunities and perspective. Students involved will bolster outreach activities of the WSU Science Ambassadors Program by traveling to area schools with educational activities and mentoring undergraduates in summer projects in the principal investigator?s Research Experience for Undergraduates program.<br/><br/>Technical Description<br/><br/>Multicomponent organic electronic systems are being increasingly explored to enhance properties and performance in devices for printable, flexible, and biocompatible applications. Recently, ternary and quaternary blends have been shown to enhance performance of organic photovoltaics to over 20% efficiencies. The high dimensionality of parameter space which are difficult to characterize, however, results in halting progress. In this project, a spectral analysis of resonant soft X-ray nanoprobes will uniquely enable definitive characterization of these complex three and four-component systems to reveal the precise morphological paradigms responsible for the ternary advantage. These nanostructure measurements will be combined with a holistic analysis of the fundamental charge generation dynamic process as well its energetics in device-relevant conditions to define the emergent excited state pathways responsible for the performance gains. The hypothesis is that mixing of guest molecules in strategic domains can tune charge transport and non-radiative losses, but collection of the guest molecules at donor-acceptor interfaces is key to lowering energetic barriers to enhance charge separation efficiencies. The aim is to establish the mechanisms of the ternary advantage and the thermodynamic and kinetic limits of these mechanisms to provide a model for further optimization through molecular design and device processing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Upon successful joint determination of an award, each Agency funds the proportion of the budget and the investigators associated with its own proposals and component of the work.<br/><br/>This research project continues an 11-year field experiment called the Integrated Characterization of Energy, Clouds, Atmospheric state, and Precipitation at Summit (ICECAPS) and adds measurements along Lagrangian transects (ICECAPS-MELT). The project is an international collaboration that has been operating ground-based instruments at Summit Station in Greenland since 2010, taking observations of the atmosphere to advance understanding of cloud properties, radiation and surface energy, and precipitation processes over the Greenland Ice Sheet. It is an important time to make these observations because Greenland is undergoing changes due to rapid shifts in Arctic climate. The current project continues the observations made at Summit Station and expands measurements along transects to another important region of Greenland called the percolation zone. In this zone, melt water is generated at the surface, where it can percolate down into the snow and then refreeze. This creates ice layers that can cause additional melt water to move horizontally rather than vertically. It is important to understand these processes because melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet is a significant contributor to global sea level, which is predicted to impact humans significantly over the next century.<br/><br/>This new ICECAPS-MELT project complements the ICECAPS Summit observatory by building a new mobile observatory for measuring parameters of the surface mass and energy budgets of the Greenland Ice Sheet. This observatory uses a novel approach for unattended, autonomous operation by supporting instruments that require moderate power and internet bandwidth yet are quite like those operated at Summit Station. The new observatory measures surface mass and energy budget parameters, including precipitation, cloud properties, radiative and turbulent fluxes, near-surface meteorology, and subsurface temperatures and structure. To do this, the ICECAPS-MELT team deploys a precipitation radar, a cloud lidar, a microwave radiometer, a ground-penetrating radar, and an automated surface flux station, which consume approximately 500 W of power under normal conditions. The project will lead to new insights into how parameters of the surface mass and energy budgets co-vary in space and time between this new observatory and the ongoing measurements at Summit. Trajectory analyses track the changes in air parcels as they ascend the Greenland Ice Sheet and pass over the two observational sites. The mobile observatory will be deployed in successive summers at Summit Station in the dry-snow zone and at the DYE-2 station in the percolation zone. If this project is successful, a network of these observatories will be proposed for future deployment in southwestern Greenland, which will provide new insights into how atmospheric properties and processes are coupled both spatially and temporally to the ice sheet?s surface and subsurface conditions over Greenland.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Thus, research on the control of migration is critical from both basic and applied perspectives. Understanding how animals decide when to move is of particular importance given that this can dictate whether or not they arrive at their destination at an appropriate time for reproduction or overwintering. Many animals move in groups and social interactions and social cues are expected to be important in the decisions that animals make in preparation for and during migration. Yet, there is little known about the role of social cues in determining when animals begin or end migration or about the physiological mechanisms by which social signals might act to influence migratory timing. This collaborative project will address these two knowledge gaps using two species of migratory songbirds that have flexible migratory schedules and that are highly sensitive to social information. Results of this work will advance our understanding of how social cues influence both migratory timing and the hormonal regulation of migration. This project will also provide training and mentoring for undergraduate and graduate students. Outreach activities linked to the project will engage elementary school students and the general public in migratory biology. Training and outreach activities at the university level and in elementary schools will target individuals from groups that are traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields.<br/><br/>The first goal of this collaborative project is to evaluate the influence of social cues (specifically, the migratory state of conspecifics) on the timing of migration. Experiments will be carried out to test the hypotheses that birds use cues from conspecifics to fine-tune timing of initiation and termination of migration. Social cues have not been well studied in the context of migratory timing and the project's inclusion of the termination phase of migration will be important in advancing the understanding of this particularly understudied phase of migration. The second goal of the project is to advance understanding of the endocrine and neuroendocrine regulation of migratory transitions, with the further objective of investigating how social cues influence endocrine and neuroendocrine parameters to potentially alter migratory timing. Thus, investigators will quantify changes in circulating steroid hormones and the availability of their receptors in the brain and peripheral tissues across transitions into and out of a migratory state. This type of whole-body approach to understanding endocrine mechanisms in the context of migration is unique. The investigators will also experimentally manipulate social cues to evaluate endocrine and neuroendocrine mechanisms by which these cues might influence migratory timing. The results of this project will thus greatly broaden understanding of the roles of social cues and plasticity of endocrine mechanisms in life history transitions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research uses plainfin midshipman fish to understand how hormones affect hearing. During the breeding season, male midshipman fish sing to attract mates, making acoustic communication vital for reproductive success. Female midshipman fish show seasonal, estrogen-dependent changes in hearing that make it easier for them to locate potential mates. This research asks how estrogen affects the production, survival, and function of sensory receptors involved in hearing to increase hearing sensitivity. This research has broader impact by increasing understanding of the natural world and providing insight into how hormones can influence the inner ear to modulate hearing ? findings that can apply to many species, including humans. This research also impacts society by exposing high school teachers and their students to both the scientific method and cutting-edge scientific techniques. As part of the M.J.

These teachers also work with the academic team to develop research-based lesson plans for the classroom. Members of the public can learn about this research through interactive museum demonstrations hosted by graduate students. In this way, non-scientists share the excitement of the science and students gain critical communication skills that they can use in the future.<br/><br/>Hormonal modulation of sensory plasticity related to reproductive cycles is widespread among vertebrates, but the underlying molecular and genetic mechanisms responsible for these steroid-dependent changes remain poorly understood. This project takes an integrated molecular, anatomical, and physiological approach to determine the effects of gonadal steroids on the adaptive auditory plasticity for encoding socially relevant acoustic signals. The objective of this study is to determine how estrogen regulates cellular and molecular changes in the inner ear of the female plainfin midshipman, leading to seasonal, steroid-dependent changes in hearing that enhance intraspecific acoustic communication to facilitate reproduction. The central hypothesis is that estrogen upregulates inner ear gene networks for progenitor cell proliferation, hair cell differentiation, and cell survival, leading to increased hair cell addition and enhanced auditory sensitivity in reproductive female midshipman fish. The experiments use both in vitro and in vivo approaches to manipulate cellular signaling (Wnt, notch, and heat shock signaling pathways) in female midshipman from different reproductive states. Changes in gene expression are assessed with qRT-PCR, cell proliferation and survival with cell biology assays and fluorescent microscopy, and auditory function with electrophysiology. These studies allow to gain insight into neural and endocrine mechanisms that may act to enhance communication in all vertebrates.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In plants, photosynthetic energy conversion is realized by pigment-protein complexes that are harbored in highly specialized thylakoid membranes inside the chloroplasts. The dynamic response of the protein landscape in thylakoid membranes to unpredictable environmental changes (i.e. fluctuations in sunlight intensity by clouds, self-shading of leaves in wind) triggers photoprotective high-energy quenching (qE) that is essential for the survival of the plant. The project will map qE-induced protein landscape dynamics in thylakoid membranes with molecular resolution as a basis for understanding key photosynthetic functions. The intellectual merit of the proposed work is that it defines an innovative and complete pipeline of methods, ranging from state-of the art electron microscopy to coarse grain computer simulations, which will provide a quantitative understanding of photosynthetic light harvesting and electron transport. This pipeline will lead to urgently needed insights into dynamic structure-function relationships in thylakoid membranes. Furthermore, it is raising protein landscape analysis to a new level with unprecedented resolution to increase our in-depth understanding of photosynthetic energy conversion. The broader impact of the project is twofold:  First, it will provide hands-on research experience to undergraduate students from underrepresented groups, and establish a new computer-based teaching tool for a computational chemistry course. Second, social benefits of the proposed work are expected for the improvement of crop plants and biofuel prospects since it turns out that optimization and adjustment of the qE mechanisms by bioengineering could be a powerful tool to increase plant performances. <br/><br/>To generate high-resolution protein maps of the thylakoid protein landscape as basis to provide mechanistic understanding for the qE-dependent regulation of light-harvesting and electron transport, three specific aims will be pursued.

Therefore, this project will examine the organizational socialization of newcomer civil engineers and will focus specifically on how the socialization process is gendered in ways that contribute to attrition from the profession. It will build on a previous longitudinal study on the same topic and will continue the long-term work of developing processes of acculturation to the engineering profession that are compatible with intersecting non-normative identities by refining and expanding an empirically-supported and engineering-specific model of gendered socialization. The integrated education and research plan will yield a dramatic impact on the field of engineering education by prioritizing the importance of underutilized gender theories, enrolling men in gender research and systems change, and addressing the gap in research on engineering workplaces. Other than the original study that this project builds on, no existing research has systematically examined the gendered organizational socialization experiences of newcomer men and women engineers. Ultimately, this project will facilitate greater equity in the socialization of newcomer engineers in order to decrease attrition from engineering careers and broaden participation of underrepresented groups in engineering. Furthermore, this project will contribute simultaneously to the fields of engineering education, engineering studies, organizational studies, and gender studies, among others.<br/><br/>The objectives of this project will be to refine and expand a theoretical model of gendered socialization in civil engineering workplaces and to create research-based interventions for more inclusive socialization. The study will involve two groups of participants. Group 1 will be early career civil engineers from around the country who have been participating in a similar study since 2018. They work in engineering firms, as well as in governmental organizations at the federal, state, and county levels. When the project begins, they will be in the fifth and sixth years of their careers. For this group, mixed-methods data will be collected longitudinally for three years through bi-monthly Individual Socialization Logs (an instrument developed during the course of the previous project) and twice-yearly in-depth interviews. The survey and interviews will explore their experiences in the workplace, including their biggest challenges, the most important things they are learning, their most memorable interactions, and their relationships with co-workers. Findings will be used to refine and expand the model that was created based on the first few years of their careers. Group 2 will be former early career civil engineers who left the engineering profession for a non-engineering career. They will participate in a one-time interview that will explore the reasons they left engineering, thought processes and timelines leading to that decision, what they think about their decisions now, workplace experiences that could have made a difference, and ways university could have better prepared them. From this data, a typology of the reasons for leaving and organizational socialization factors that played a role will be created. That typology will then be compared to the existing theoretical model and survey instrument to determine what additions need to be made to both in light of the experiences of those who have left civil engineering. Project outcomes will include identification and characterization of facets of organizational socialization (e.g., practices, processes, relationships and social networks) that are gendered, including how they are gendered intersectionally. Research findings and the model based on them will be utilized to create professional formation materials for civil engineering professionals. The professional formation materials will be implemented nationally and locally.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A high cost of production could put strawberry-growers in the U.S. at a disadvantage in comparison to countries whose cost of labor is much less. In order to make strawberry production in the U.S. competitive with the rest of the world, production costs need to be reduced. This project aims to investigate developing a small, rugged, and cost-effective co-robot system that can be used by growers, which will ultimately lower the harvesting costs and increase profitability of strawberry production. Additionally, the research results can benefit other high value specialty crops, such as tomatoes and blueberries, as they are facing similar labor shortage issues. This multi-disciplinary research will enrich course curricula which benefits a large number of students at three participating universities, and will provide research and development experiences to students of underrepresented and minority backgrounds.

Additionally, a graphic user interface will be developed, which is adaptable as an assistive device to benefit users with disabilities. <br/><br/>The project includes three primary research thrusts. The first thrust will investigate a decentralized, scalable row allocation algorithm for robots to achieve a consensus about which rows to harvest, in order to achieve an overall minimum time in harvesting. The algorithm is expected to be scalable, efficient, fast, non-conflicting, and simple.

Under the Energy Independence Security Act of 2007, the U.S. has established a national goal of replacing 30% of petroleum-based fuels with plant-based lignocellulosic fuels by the year 2030. However, the efficiency of currently applied methods for the manufacturing of lignocellulosic biofuels is significantly hindered by the presence of lignin in the cell wall. Lignin, a polymer formed from the oxidative polymerization of monolignol and related compounds, shields cellulose from processing with hydrolytic enzymes, posing a major challenge to economically viable biofuel production. The proposed research will provide the fundamental knowledge necessary to tune the chemical composition of the cell walls of plants for optimal use in biofuel production. The broader impacts, beyond application to biofuel production, include the training of undergraduate and graduate students in multidisciplinary and quantitative methods.  <br/><br/>The accumulated knowledge resulting from this research will guide the formulation of efficient enzymes for the biosynthesis of lignin with properties that make it more amenable to biofuel production. The PIs target sorghum specifically, but the results will be generally applicable to most monolignol pathways in a majority of commercially important crop/forestry species. The study uses state-of-the-art single molecule methods, X-ray crystallography, spectroscopy, and thermochemical techniques to develop a detailed framework that describes critical oxidative steps within the monolignol biosynthetic pathway.  The work proposed will focus on: (1) protein-protein interaction between the P450s in the pathway (C4H, C3?H, and F5H) and their primary redox partner cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR), (2) the substrate specificity of the targeted P450s, (3) the effect of redox state and substrate-binding on the complex formation of P450-CPR and C4H-PAL.

These time intervals in the Precambrian also reflect a transition to modern plate tectonic processes, resulting in collision and assembly of smaller crustal fragments into continents and supercontinents. Rocks at the northwest margin of the Wyoming province in southwestern Montana provide a record of these processes during formation of the North American continent. This project will utilize an integrated approach by applying petrologic, geochemical, and geochronologic tools to establish relative contributions of crustal growth versus subsequent modification by tectonic processes. The major outcomes of this work will be a better understanding of the balance between crustal preservation and growth during continental assembly. This project will promote teaching and training by supporting graduate and undergraduate research, and results of this study will be incorporated into undergraduate class field trips and laboratory curricula. Infrastructure for research and education will be enhanced through the development and refinement of new geochronological techniques, and by providing training for students in state-of-the-art analytical equipment. New age data from this project will be integrated into current Montana state geologic mapping efforts to better interpret the overall ages of rock units and structural relationships. Outreach efforts will include presenting informal science talks for students and faculty from schools nationwide that conduct summer field courses in southwest Montana.<br/><br/>Two intervals in the Neoarchean and Paleoproterozoic represent major periods in the growth and assembly of North America as well as continents worldwide. These periods have been inferred to correspond to times of enhanced production of continental crust. This project will examine the processes that have operated during these time intervals to produce new continental crust as well as the processes operating to rework and assemble this crust. The northwest margin of the Wyoming province in southwestern Montana is an ideal natural laboratory for this study because it is comprised of a diverse suite of metasedimentary garnet-bearing lithologies that are amenable to Pressure-temperature-time studies, as well as containing interlayered meta-igneous rocks that are poorly dated. The proposed work will apply an integrated approach of metamorphic phase equilibria and geochronology of Neoarchean to Paleoproterozoic rocks in the Laramide basement-cored uplifts of the Montana Metasedimentary Terrane to establish relative crustal growth versus modification during these time intervals. Data collected will determine the conditions, timing, duration, and spatial extent of magmatism and metamorphism through metamorphic phase equilibria, Uranium-Lead (U-Pb) geo- and thermochronology of zircon, monazite, and titanite, Hafnium (Hf) and Neodymium (Nd) isotopic analysis of zircon and monazite, and Lutetium-Hafnium/Samarium-Neodymium (Lu-Hf/Sm-Nd) dating of garnet. This integration of tools will provide temporal resolution magmatic and metamorphic histories and directly constrain the growth and modification history of the northwestern Wyoming province.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Monitoring and modeling evaporation over water surfaces such as lakes and oceans remains challenging. Better quantification and modeling of water evaporation requires improved understanding of the physical processes across the water-atmosphere interface. An outstanding scientific question is the role of the top water layer where temperature increases with depth, known as the inverse-temperature layer, in evaporation. An interdisciplinary team of hydro-meteorologists and fluid mechanics scientists will use cutting-edge field and numerical experiment technology and various modeling tools to address this question. The outcomes from this project will benefit broad fields of the Earth Sciences, especially the study of water-energy-carbon cycles. This project will train graduate students to gain all-around research experience. The three participating universities will offer mini projects, seminar series, and summer training courses for high school and college students with diverse ethnic backgrounds pursuing science and engineering education.<br/><br/>The project objective is to understand the physical mechanisms underlying the dynamics of the inverse-temperature layer on the top of water-bodies and its effect on evaporation over water surfaces at diurnal and seasonal scales through field experiments, large-eddy simulations, and theoretical and modeling analysis. The project will use a state-of-the-science facility over an in-land lake to measure high-resolution water temperature profiles, above- and in-water fluxes of momentum/heat/water mass and hydro-meteorological variables to reveal the behavior of the inverse temperature layer. The project team will conduct large-eddy simulations to understand the mechanistic links between atmospheric processes and in-water fluid dynamics/thermodynamics regulating the inverse temperature layer and evaporation. The team will also use field and simulation data to evaluate the performance of classical and recently developed parameterizations of evaporation in coupled land-ocean-atmosphere models. The findings will be disseminated to scientific communities through journal papers and conference presentations to promote more collaborative research on both long-lasting topics of geosciences and critical emerging issues such as carbon emissions from global inland waters and associated aquatic eco-systems.

The value of the facility is based on its location, well above the Arctic circle, high enough in elevation to be in the free troposphere, not influenced by human settlements or the moderating effects of the ocean, and the site of the Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2 (GISP2) deep ice core. Summit Station (72oN, 38oW, 3250 m.a.s.l.) hosts the Greenland Environmental Observatory (GEOSummit), the only NSF site with permission from the Government of Greenland and the Danish Commission for Scientific Research in Greenland to provide long-term environmental measurements. Summit Station is staffed year-round and fills an important niche in the international scientific community?s global measurement capability. The Science Coordination Office (SCO) for Summit Station represents research interests that utilize the station, providing regular feedback to the managers of the Arctic Research Support and Logistics Program (RSL) and conveying information back to the research community about NSFs plans for the station. The SCO presents the needs and desires of the science community working on the ice sheet in interior Greenland in discussions and decision making process between RSL and their primary logistics support contractor. NSF has stated plans to recapitalize the infrastructure at Summit Station over the next 8 years and the SCO will ensure there is communication with the research community throughout the planning and design process. The SCO concurs with NSF?s goals to make a safe and sustainable Summit Station elevated above the drifting snow and preserving the clean air and clean snow research areas. The GEOSummit website has resources for new Principal Investigators, students and educators. <br/><br/>Summit Station, Greeland is the site of decades of study of the past climate through deep ice cores, and studies of atmospheric chemistry, snow processes and, more recently, the study of high-energy neutrinos from the origins of the universe. Through this effort, the SCO will ensure that plans to operate and in coming years to recapitalize the infrastructure at Summit Station will be done with the interests of the research community. The SCO meets weekly with the arctic logistics contractor science support, logistics and operations at Summit Station to remain informed about plans and communicate research interests. The SCO is invited to review documents and provide input on plans for Summit Station. The Radio Neutrino Observatory for Greenland (RNO-G) project has installed 6 detector nodes of a planned 30-node network. SCO will continue to advocate for Summit Station site plans that accommodate an influx of astrophysical research while maintaining long standing focus on climate relevant research which needs clean air and snow conditions. This plan will also welcome and support researchers from a range of other disciplines, and will include opportunities to educate students and new researchers, but must keep everyone from inadvertently interfering with each other. The SCO website is a keystone of  communication to the science community, with several features added over the past few years such as the Google Earth based GIS -- recording activity in the region over the past 12 years -- a virtual tour using Streetview images, a new Working at Summit section targeting new investigators, a comprehensive bibliography of published work near Summit, and a quarterly Newsletter.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This work will honor and uphold Indigenous knowledge by fully engaging Tribal nations and people at every step of project development.  Ultimately, this project will lay the groundwork for land-grant institutions in the US to honor and uphold Indigenous knowledge by fully engaging Tribal nations and people at every step of project development so Indigenous systems can be applied together with Western knowledge systems to shed new light on biological systems resilience.<br/><br/>This work will intertwine Western scientific approaches to learning about biological systems resilience with Indigenous knowledge to train mentees in the Indigenous paradigm of ?two-eyed seeing.? Further, employing Indigenous research methodologies in the project will enable participants (mentees, mentors, and co-mentors) to explore the cultural theme of Tribal nation building in academia. Within this program, there will be full integration of Tribal sovereignty and self-determination and a spirit of community and public leadership that aligns with long-term decision making. The project will support ~30 post-bac mentees who identify as Native American/Native Alaskan/Indigenous. Mentees will be supported in developing scientific, professional, and cultural skills that will position them to pursue further education or STEM activities in and with tribal communities. Biological systems of study will range from the molecular to the landscape and ecosystem scales, including mechanisms of salmon hatchery resilience, long-term agroforestry disease resistance, and the impacts of soil health and stewardship on tribal food sovereignty.

Spin causes some atomic particles (e.g., electrons, protons, and many atomic nuclei) to behave like spinning magnets.  Much the way rotating magnets produce currents in a nearby coil (as with hydroelectric power), samples of atoms possessing spin, if the magnets are all aligned together (``polarized?), can be detected and manipulated with a nearby coil of wire. The PI uses ?optical pumping,? a process involving lasers that transfers spin from light to rubidium or cesium atoms, which then collide with xenon atoms to create samples of spin-polarized xenon nuclei.  The activities and goals in this project are centered on understanding and maximizing the efficiency of spin transfer to xenon nuclei. The PI?s GOALI partner, Polarean, Inc. (Durham, North Carolina), engineers and markets xenon polarizers, which can be used in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), particularly of the human lung. MRI normally relies on the presence of water in human tissues to produce an image, but there is very little water in the gas space of the lung. Xenon gas is non-toxic and is not metabolized by the body, but the spin polarization causes the gas to ?light up? on an MRI the same way that water does in other tissues.  This technique has enormous potential to answer important questions about lung function and lung disease (the fourth leading cause of death in the United States) but making the technique reliable and cost-effective depends on the work done in this project to understand the physics of spin transfer. Beyond this application, spin is playing an important role in the ongoing second quantum revolution, where we now speak of ?spintronics? (the spin version of electronics), and spin properties have become important in implementations of quantum computing and related technologies. Students are ?hands-on? in the lab learning electronics, vacuum technology, plumbing, and even some glass blowing; they are technically well trained but also come out in possession of skills that can serve them in a host of other occupations, both in and outside of the academy. Promoting equity, diversity, and inclusion in the laboratory environment is a goal. Historically about half of the undergraduate researchers in the group have been women. This project will also both complement and benefit from a newly awarded departmental NSF-REU project. <br/><br/>Technical audience abstract:<br/>The stable spin-1/2 isotopes 3He and 129Xe are readily hyperpolarized (HP) to levels exceeding 10% via spin-exchange optical pumping (SEOP). SEOP of 129Xe is of particular interest because it is both less well understood and likely to supersede 3He as the nucleus of choice for noble-gas MRI. Together with the GOALI partner, Polarean, the PI seeks both to address persistent yet critical physics issues in SEOP of 129Xe and to implement this knowledge in a commercial polarization device. The three main research aims are: 1) Measurement of Rb and Cs spin destruction due to Xe in the less-studied regime of low Xe partial density and low total gas density (tens of torr and below). 2) Measurement of 129Xe spin-exchange rates at low gas densities for both Rb-129Xe and Cs-129Xe in the same low-density regime as in Aim 1, where van der Waals molecules have longer lifetimes and spin-exchange times should be fast (minutes to seconds). Together, Aims 1 and 2 allow determination of the spin-exchange efficiency, the crucial figure of merit for evaluating efficient production of HP gases. The project also aims to characterize ?hybrid? cells, containing both Rb and Cs, to determine whether specific vapor-pressure ratios optimize SEOP efficiency. 3) Search for direct evidence of the presence of alkali-metal nanoclusters in a SEOP polarizer, incorporate their effects into the ?standard model? for hyperpolarized 129Xe production, and begin to develop strategies to eliminate them or mitigate their effects. The main experimental approach is EPR spectroscopy of the alkali-metal atoms using Faraday rotation, whereby two specific techniques have been developed:  a cw ?frequency locking? technique to measure the polarized 129Xe magnetic field, and a pulsed technique (analogous to pulsed NMR) to rapidly acquire the entire hyperfine spectrum.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research will be integrated both with experimental surface science and catalysis studies at Tufts and related educational and outreach programs targeting underrepresented groups (including American Indians) at the high school through graduate school levels.<br/><br/>A multi-scale model will be developed to predict the catalytic behavior of low-temperature exhaust catalysts in real-world conditions. The central hypothesis is that the chemical modification of a first-row transition metal oxide with an atomically dispersed precious metal will display theoretical efficiencies that are superior to pure-precious-metal catalysts, and that these high efficiencies will be connected to the support's ability to control the oxidation state of the atomically dispersed metal. To this end, a comprehensive model - developed from high quality characterization data obtained from other groups - will be used to predict exhaust-gas related reactions such as CO oxidation and the water-gas shift reaction, on atomically dispersed platinum with a well-defined copper surface oxide support. The educational and outreach objectives will demonstrate how computational modeling tools can be used in conjunction with experimental data to accelerate the discovery of new catalyst materials and structures.

In fact, the vast majority (over 80%) of modern software systems are multi-language software. Meanwhile, software failures are known to be costly, and a common methodology for preventing these failures and reducing the cost is to reason about run-time behaviors of software (i.e., dynamic program reasoning). However, extant software-quality assurance support based on dynamic program reasoning still focuses on, and is limited to, software developed in single languages, largely dismissing what happens at and across language boundaries. As a result, cross-language behaviors are left unattended and holistic quality assurance of multi-language systems is critically lacking. This project aims to advance the state of knowledge about software-quality assurance by enabling practical dynamic program reasoning across language boundaries. The research will result in a new foundation of dynamic analysis and a series of application tools to diagnose cross-language correctness and security issues, which will help produce multi-language systems of improved quality. Moreover, this project will have an industrial impact realized through collaborations with and result disseminations via industrial partners, and will broaden the participation in computing of underrepresented minorities. <br/><br/>The technical aims of the project are divided into three thrusts. First, multi-language code-construction mechanisms and their effects on the resulting software?s behavior and quality will be characterized. This will produce new knowledge about how modern multi-language software is constructed in terms of language selection and interoperation. Then, in the second thrust, practically scalable and cost-effective analyses for holistic cross-language dependence reasoning will be developed, as informed by the knowledge and insights gained from the characterization study. The key principle is to model and reason about cross-language code dependencies in a way that not only overcomes semantics disparities caused by language heterogeneity but also readily accommodates new/additional languages. The third thrust will build on the cross-language dependence reasoning to develop practically efficient and precise cross-language information flow reasoning, which will then provide immediate support for diagnosing program faults regarding functionality bugs and security vulnerabilities across language boundaries. This project will validate the generated new knowledge and techniques through extensive evaluation against real-world, complex multi-language systems in terms of scalability, cost-effectiveness, and capabilities in practical applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This mixing controls the fate of a multitude of dissolved solutes, such as nutrients essential to the ecosystem, dissolved minerals from natural weathering, pharmaceuticals from wastewater treatment plant discharge, and contaminants from nearby sources. Practically useful computer models of how solutes are transported, including how they are exchanged back and forth between riverbed sediments and the river itself, are needed to understand water quality in rivers.  Recent research suggests that these transport processes are missed by state-of-the-art computer models. This project will develop a general approach to building adaptable computer models based on recently developed tools in mathematical modeling, including artificial intelligence, to investigate how to specialize general models for particular rivers. The project will generate a large database of experimental results from river transport studies from around the globe. The database will be used to extract patterns associated with solute transport and will be disseminated broadly with the scientific community. The project team will host annual workshops to enhance database sharing, distribute educational modules on the use of artificial intelligence in hydrological sciences, and discuss approaches to standardize data collection. <br/><br/>The goals of this project are to develop a comprehensive database of river tracer testing data for open sharing with the scientific community, and to develop and test a novel generalized model of solute transport in river corridors. The activities proposed center around the construction of a community-available, large database of tracer tests performed in streams and rivers worldwide, and its use as curricula for machine learning of model properties. Congruent data analytics will be performed to identify correlations among key variables of both river and tracer test properties, treating breakthrough curves not individually but in the tracer test sets in which they are measured. Uncertainty in experimentally measured solute concentrations will be formally addressed and used to describe model predictive power. The models selected for evaluation range from the classical transient storage model to a new model designed to address the hypothesis that residence time in the river and in the hyporheic zone both matter to exchange fluxes.  Both conventional inverse modeling and machine learning tools will be applied in dual model calibration tasks, bringing uniquely powerful physics-informed neural networks to bear on this challenging problem.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Soil health reflects the ability of soil to support both plant growth and other ecosystems. To date, there is limited knowledge on how soil microbiome compositions and activities are associated with electrochemical signals in the soil environment. Electrochemical signals produced by organisms in soil can be used to advance non-destructive monitoring of belowground microbiomes and their functional relationships to soil health and plant productivity. The correlations between soil microbiome structure and function and electrochemical signals can be used as a sensor. Such a sensor can be used to predict and control soil health in real-time to improve plant productivity. This project will train undergraduate and graduate students in the fields of microbial electrochemistry, microbial ecology and -omics, and data science to help generate a much needed workforce with expertise in data- and model-driven soil science and engineering. If successful, this work will develop tools to support future ecosystem research in new ways and help protect the Nation?s food security by enabling more support for sustainable agriculture decisions.  <br/><br/>The soil microbiome plays critical roles in plant growth and ecosystem services with relevance to both managed and wild terrestrial habitats. This microbiome is one of the most challenging systems to study due to high biological diversity and spatial heterogeneity. Most work to date focused on dissecting the genomic and metabolic basis of interactions within the microbiome and between the microbiome and plant hosts. However, there is a lack of measurements that would enable rapid assessment of community structure and function for the purposes of microbiome monitoring, management, and manipulation. In addition, there is limited knowledge on the correlations between electrochemical signals, microbiome structure and function, and soil. Uncovering these relationships will provide foundational knowledge that will enable new ways of monitoring and manipulating plant and soil microbiomes. One novel approach will take advantage of the fact that much of metabolism conducted by living organisms is redox chemistry. This chemistry is measurable through extracellular electron transfer?electrochemical signals. The project goal is to understand electrochemical signals in plant-soil-microbe systems and develop rules relating electrochemical signals to microbiome function in a model agricultural system. The project activities include 1) investigation of electron transfer mechanisms in soil to link electrochemical signals, local chemical conditions, and microbial community structure and function; 2) investigation of feedbacks between electrochemical signals, microbiomes and plant phenotypes, and performance; and 3) extraction of rules from high-dimensional data correlating microbiome structure and function to electrochemical signals and plant phenotypes and sensor.

In many cases, the musculoskeletal system handles these obstacles by itself, independent of control by the nervous system, but the exact mechanisms by which this occurs are not thoroughly understood. The overall objective of this proposal is to elucidate how specific features within the musculoskeletal system achieve the appropriate locomotor behaviors without needing reflex interventions from the nervous system. To achieve this objective, the researchers will study bipedal hopping by kangaroo rats within the context of abrupt changes in slope that can disrupt forward velocity and/or cause unwanted rotational pitch of the body. Novel experiments using a specially designed rotational treadmill will make it possible to expose kangaroo rats to controlled perturbations that mimic ecologically relevant obstacles. The conceptual framework of the studies is that the components of the musculoskeletal system represent an embedded intelligence that can ease the computational burden of centralized controllers for complex dynamic systems. We advance this idea by investigating specific examples in which specialized properties link functional demands, conditional properties, and system state. Translation of the findings can solve long-standing challenges for robots moving stably over variable terrains. Furthermore, the project will involve local high school teachers, who will develop, test, implement, and assess teaching modules based upon the ongoing research to encourage pre-college students to appreciate how the study of basic biology and engineering applications are complementary. <br/><br/>The objective of this project is to elucidate how nonlinearities within the musculoskeletal system express contextually appropriate system properties to achieve desired motor function without needing neural feedback. The approach is to study bipedal hopping by kangaroo rats with abrupt changes in slope that can disrupt forward velocity and/or cause unwanted pitch. More specifically, the research will examine how the actions of ankle extensors are coupled to the mechanics of the feet, and how this coupling is modulated by the nonlinear features of tendon. This coupling is hypothesized to provide the functional benefit of automatically making the foot compliant upon landing to mediate perturbations and then stiff at takeoff to enable propulsion. To test this hypothesis, the research team will use an integrated framework of in vivo, in situ, and in silico methods to obtain behavioral data, test mechanistic hypotheses, and manipulate component properties, respectively. A novel custom-designed rotational treadmill will make it possible to have controlled perturbations that mimic ecologically relevant obstacles. More generally, nonlinearities expressed by a system?s components can expand a system?s range of operating conditions and contexts. The findings will provide guidance for the design of nonlinearities, namely, their type and parameterization, so that the nonlinearities will be advantageous for achieving function while interacting with unpredictable environments. By collaborating with local high school teachers, the PIs will build a network of STEM teachers who will develop, test, implement, and assess teaching modules based upon the research.

Hydrogen, when produced using renewable energy sources, is considered as one of the most promising fuels for the future, and does not emit harmful pollutants when reacting with oxygen. However, being the lightest element, hydrogen in the gaseous form requires large containers for storage and is considered impractical for many applications. Liquid hydrogen is a very attractive compact energy source, but it can exist only at very low temperatures. Current cooling techniques for both liquefaction and storage of hydrogen are rather inefficient. To help make the hydrogen economy viable, a potentially efficient novel acoustic method for coupled cooling-conversion of cryogenic hydrogen is explored of this project. The accompanying educational and outreach activities aim at improving engineering education by developing materials for energy-related courses, summer programs for K-12 students, professional short courses, and a textbook on cryogenic hydrogen systems.<br/><br/>The necessary steps to prepare hydrogen for liquefaction and subsequent storage in the low energy state include cryogenic cooling and spin-conversion. These processes can be potentially combined by employing thermoacoustic heat pumping in a porous matrix which will also serve as a catalytic bed, accelerating conversion of flowing orthohydrogen into parahydrogen. The exploration of this combined process and associated thermal transport, fluid flow, quantum transitions, dynamic regimes, and system engineering constitutes the intellectual significance of the proposed research. Modeling efforts will include development of a reduced-order framework for analysis of thermoacoustic-catalytic systems for cooling cryogenic hydrogen and setting up high-fidelity computational simulations, while incorporating models from different scientific and technical areas.

Due to unfavorable propagation conditions and attenuation at high frequencies, mmW networks require the densification of base stations and radios equipped with a large number of antennas to compensate path loss via directional gain using narrow beams. The cost and power consumption of radios with antenna arrays present a significant challenge, and their architecture is of fundamental importance and influence on the entire networking stack. State-of-the-art approaches based on phased antenna array architecture are faced with several fundamental problems when radio bandwidth and the number of antennas increases including prohibitive latency in initial connectivity and link management, distortion in the directionality of the beams, reduced beamforming gain, and ability to suppress the interference in dense deployments. This project aims to develop and demonstrate a novel adaptive true-time-delay (TTD) based array for wideband mmW networks and overcome challenges of phased antenna arrays. The approach involves co-design and optimization of tunable radio frequency (RF) circuits, antenna array system, signal processing, and network protocols for low latency access, wideband beamforming gain, and interference management. <br/>  <br/>The research work will pursue four key thrusts: Thrust 1 will develop TTD array-based fast beam training and spatial interference detection and estimation for mmW networks with large modulated bandwidth. The objective is to reduce the overhead in initial access due to beam training by exploiting frequency-dependent antenna weight vectors in TTD arrays through signal processing and develop a low latency protocol design for simultaneous beam training and interference estimation in dense mmW networks. Thrust 2 will focus on the data communication design using TTD arrays to facilitate multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) multiplexing and suppress interference from co-channel base stations and users. The main challenge is to achieve high beamforming gain over a wide modulated bandwidth together with effective nulling of wideband interferers. Thrust 3 will develop an experimental testbed for the evaluation of signal processing algorithms and protocols from Thrusts 1 and 2. It will involve the integration of widely reconfigurable delay compensating circuits and custom mmW front-end at 28GHz into a 16-element TTD antenna array.

We need a diverse and globally engaged workforce to study these changes in water resources. Focusing on Latin America, this Partnerships Along the Headwaters of the Americas for Young Scientists Program trains graduate students from across the United States to study these complex water management problems so that we may ensure the viability of headwater-dependent communities across the Americas into the future.

A fundamental goal in biology is understanding how the environment affects human and wildlife health. Stressful environments, for instance, can make animals more susceptible to infection. But it is difficult to predict or manage the effects of stress on disease outbreaks because there are many complex, interacting processes. In addition, individuals may not respond the same way to stress. This research project will test whether chronic stress weakens the immune system during key times in an animal's development termed 'critical windows' of susceptibility. It will test whether animals are more easily infected, better at spreading the infection, and more likely to die. These results will then be used to test whether environmental stressors make disease outbreaks more likely and severe for whole populations. This work will help prioritize actions to prevent or lessen disease outbreaks. It will also provide a more sophisticated framework for studying animal diseases. In addition, the researchers will develop new teaching modules and workshops to help inform state, federal, and academic scientists, land managers, teachers, and college students about the ways in which stress affects disease outcomes. <br/><br/>The projects will use a ranavirus, an often-lethal pathogen of amphibians, and their wood frog tadpole hosts as model system to test three specific hypotheses: environmental stressors 1) increase the average susceptibility of hosts, 2) change the timing and duration of critical windows of susceptibility, and 3) magnify initially small differences in susceptibility among hosts. A series of dose-response experiments will characterize the windows and distribution of susceptibility (both resistance to and tolerance of ranavirus infections) and determine how they are affected by high salinity and elevated temperature - two relevant and increasingly important environmental challenges.

In 2021, the U.S. grain export accounted for over 40% share of international grain trade. Millions of U.S. farmers depend on international market for living and prosperity. However, the U.S. grain export is not only facing tough competition from other export countries, but also impacted by grain yield in import countries. In order to gain the competitive edge, stakeholders need to know as early as possible where and how many acres each type of crops that have been planted in a growing season around the world so that yield can be estimated, production and demand balance can be assessed, and grain prices can be predicted. This requires generating in-season crop maps of both U.S. and foreign countries. The classic method to generate in-season crop maps needs a large amount of verified information on crops (i.e., ground truths) to train algorithms for classifying in-season satellite remote sensing images. However, it is difficult or even impossible to obtain ground truths in foreign countries, particularly in early season. This study proposes to develop a spatiotemporally transferable machine-learning algorithm which will be trained with U.S. data and applied to in-season satellite remote sensing images of foreign countries for creating the in-season crop maps of the countries. Success of this project will make the in-season crop mapping of foreign countries possible. The project will significantly enhance the competitiveness and profitability of U.S. agriculture, increase the food security of the world, and potentially bring billions-of-dollars economic benefits to U.S. farmers.<br/><br/>Satellite remote sensing with ground truth tagging is the current practice for crop mapping. However, it suffers from two problems: 1) Unavailability of ground truth in foreign countries; 2) Spatiotemporal intransferability of trained classifiers. This study will design spatiotemporally transferable learning algorithm and temporal learning strategy that would maximally transfer label data and models from U.S. to foreign countries. The proposed method utilizes adversarial training and contrastive learning. Through this two-player game, the feature extractor produces domain-invariant features. A classifier trained on this domain-invariant representation can transfer its model to a new domain because the target features match those seen during training, thus bridging the gap between times and locations. The U.S. trained algorithm will be tested in Canada and Brazil to demonstrate its cross-country and cross-hemisphere transferability.

For example, a solid oxide electrolysis cell can provide hydrogen via steam electrolysis. Alternatively, as envisioned in this work, such a system can also provide syngas (carbon monoxide and hydrogen) from steam and carbon dioxide. Such complex systems operate with high efficiency and can use electricity obtained from intermittent power sources. However, their performance requires proper optimization to avoid degradation. Recent work has shown that mixed ionic-electronic conducting oxide-based cathodes exhibit promising activity and stability, which facilitates the use of pure carbon dioxide in the feed. However, a fundamental understanding of how these oxides work for processing of carbon dioxide is still limited. In this project, PIs Nikolla and McEwen integrate experiments and theory to determine how a mixed ionic-electronic conducting ceramic material interacts with carbon dioxide to facilitate its processing. Design criteria for identification of robust (active and stable) oxide cathodes in a solid oxide electrolysis cell environment are being developed. PIs Nikolla and McEwen are also actively engaged in outreach activities through training graduate and undergraduate students, who typically find employment in industry or academia. The research team also partners with industry by interacting with the Toyota Research Center. As such, this research exposes students to an industrial research environment and enables them to see the link between fundamental work in academia and application in industry.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: Experimental and theoretical techniques are combined to develop a fundamental understanding of the electrochemical reduction of CO2 on mixed ionic-electronic conducting (MIEC) oxides. This fundamental understanding then enables design criteria for identification of robust (active and stable) oxides as solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) cathodes to be defined. SOECs are high temperature, solid-state electrolyzers characterized by high efficiencies and unique scalability. In this project, the heterogeneities in an oxide layer, which alter the local electric field at its surface and correlate to the performance of a SOEC, are examined and the effect of the composition on the reducibility of MIEC oxides is elucidated. This knowledge is used to define the design criteria for robust MIEC-cathode SOECs. Activities that enhance the education of the next generation of students, including a summer research exchange program among the two groups for students, and partnerships with the Toyota Research Center that expose students to an industrial research environment and provide a link between the fundamental work in academia and application in industry, ensure the broad impacts of this project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In recent decades, wildfires have become an increasing threat to humans, the built environment, and ecosystems due to climate change, increased human activities at the wildland-urban interface, and changes in land use. While federal, state, and local governments have developed and implemented risk management strategies to reduce the frequency and negative impact of large wildfires, these strategies are often based on static, outdated, and coarse-scale estimates of wildfire risk. Moreover, they do not often engage citizens whose actions are crucial for reducing damage at the property level and whose protective efforts affect the risk levels of their neighbors and the surrounding environment. A lack of sustained citizen engagement and limited information flows in hazard-prone communities presents a barrier to informed, optimal decision-making by both government officials and individuals. This CAREER project aims to integrate fire science, risk assessment principles, and decision-making processes to establish the foundation for a new approach to wildfire risk assessment and management that evolves over time and captures relevant changes occurring at multiple spatial-temporal scales. This integrated approach centers around a dynamic, interactive, next-generation Community Wildfire Protection Plan (CWPP) platform that facilitates active citizen engagement and multidirectional information exchange. The project provides students, practitioners, policymakers, and the public with opportunities to advance their understanding of wildfire risks and contribute to mitigating its negative impacts through new academic courses, training sessions, and an online exhibition. <br/><br/>This CAREER project stimulates a paradigm shift from traditional, static wildfire risk assessment and management plans to a dynamic, interactive platform that (a) allows citizens to engage with their local governments and neighbors in mitigation decision processes and (b) enables both governments and citizens to make joint risk-informed decisions about wildfire mitigation through multidirectional information exchanges. This project first builds an evolutionary game-theoretic model to characterize decision-making between governments and citizens in interdependent wildfire risk contexts. It then develops a risk assessment model that employs ongoing data collection and processing over time. Finally, this project integrates these models and tools into a prototype CWPP platform to demonstrate its technical feasibility and cost-effectiveness while soliciting user feedback. By fostering collaboration between local governments and citizens, the project has the potential to aid the transition of the responsibility for disaster risk reduction from emergency personnel to that of the entire community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Students learn most effectively by doing rather than merely watching and listening. At the undergraduate level in sciences, this translates into learning science by doing science. It is well-known that undergraduates have improved outcomes in performance, persistence, and progress when they engage in hands-on research; that is, doing what scientists in any field do. These improved outcomes could be particularly valuable for students from minoritized groups and first-generation college students. At the same time, access to research experiences as undergraduates in the form of traditional apprenticeship-based laboratory research has historically favored majority-group students. CUREs have been shown to provide some of the same benefits as traditional research experiences, but at a much broader scale, at lower cost, and with shorter time commitments. This project will provide broad access to learning-by-doing in biochemistry research by lowering barriers to implementing CUREs.  The project intends to assess participation in a previously developed biochemistry CURE, the Biochemistry Authentic Science Inquiry Laboratory (BASIL). The project will engage with faculty at institutions whose students will most benefit from increased access to research experiences, with a focus on Minority-Serving Institutions. <br/><br/>The BASIL CURE is fully implemented on ten campuses. More than 25 other campuses are exploring and/or using parts of the curriculum through prior work. The project will add 50 more campuses to the project over the next 5 years through a series of recruiting and training workshops and through a well-designed mentoring program. The project will focus on Minority-Serving Institutions, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal Colleges, and Community Colleges. The goal of the project is to investigate the processes by which CUREs are adopted, implemented, and sustained with three specific aims: Aim 1. Identify the supports for and barriers to CURE implementation and sustainability across institution types; Aim 2. Characterize the relationship between institutional context and variations in CURE implementation across institution types; and Aim 3. Facilitate implementation and sustainability in diverse contexts through faculty development. The project will collect data from participating faculty by administering and collecting (a) pre-engagement surveys, (b) implementation plans, (c) implementation surveys, and (d) semi-structured interviews.  The project will partner with other established CURE communities in the field to assess the process of CURE implementation for any barriers such as impacts of cost, institutional support, or faculty workload.  The project will also assess the sustainability of the CURE strategy across participating campuses based on demographics, size, location, and other factors.  As a result of this implementation and assessment process, the project seeks to contribute to strengthening the diverse workforce in sciences, technology, and medicine.

The most common type of software development project is called a Brownfield project, in which a software solution is developed within an existing software system. In a Brownfield project, developers modify, debug, refine, and expand an existing code base that they may not have been originally involved in writing.  Although most modern software design projects are Brownfield projects, undergraduate computer science curricula focus almost exclusively on teaching students to write code from scratch. This emphasis on ""design from scratch"" leads to graduates who lack key soft skills required in the software profession today. These skills include the ability to plan, reflect on, and direct the programming process; the ability to locate, assess, and apply needed information; and the ability to ask and answer questions in team settings. This project aims to involve instructors, students, education experts, and professional software developers in designing Brownfield programming assignments and teaching strategies that will help undergraduates in computer science courses gain these skills. The project includes a series of rigorous research studies that will provide insights into the educational effectiveness of this educational approach. The findings from these studies will inform efforts to integrate Brownfield projects into undergraduate STEM education at other colleges or universities and in other STEM fields. <br/><br/>The Brownfield pedagogy will apply social learning theory.  It will require students to first complete a series of multimedia instructional modules that provide explicit instruction on the targeted soft skills (i.e. metacognition, information literacy, and communication). Students will then be placed on teams and tasked with fixing bugs and implementing features in an existing code base. A specialized dashboard will scaffold the process through strategic prompts and guidance. The dashboard will also log data about the students' software development processes, search queries, and online interactions with teammates. The project will use a participatory design process for iterative improvements that enable the pedagogy to be educationally effective and readily adaptable to a variety of instructional contexts. Through pilot studies and a quasi-experimental study involving 10 instructors and over 4,500 students at seven diverse institutions, the project will gain insight into the pedagogy's educational effectiveness. The study will explore the relationships between formation of soft skills and development of programming abilities. In addition, the project will contribute novel approaches to measuring soft skills development and new understandings of the interplay between soft and technical skills development. It also aims to develop new theories about the collective contributions of metacognitive, information literacy, and communication skills in self-regulated learning and technical skills development. The pedagogy and technologies developed through this project may be useful as a model for supporting and assessing Brownfield projects in other STEM disciplines. As a result, the project addresses a national priority by helping to produce graduates who possess 21st century STEM workplace skills. This Engaged Student Learning project is supported by the NSF Improving Undergraduate STEM Education Program: Education and Human Resources (IUSE: EHR), which supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all undergraduate students.

Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, causing about 30 times as much global warming per molecule as carbon dioxide. It is currently known that methane can be emitted from the trunks of trees, but it is unknown if the methane originates in the soil and is transported into the tree along with tree water uptake from below ground, or if the methane originates inside the tree. Understanding what water and environment factors influence methane emissions from trees can improve climate predictions and may help people manage forests and forested wetlands deliberately to reduce their natural methane emissions. The project will also work with a local elementary school serving talented and gifted students primarily from underrepresented groups (Black, Latinx). About 200 second-grade students will visit American University, where they will learn about watersheds, trees, and sustainability and participate in activities to develop a science identity.<br/><br/>This research will use radon as a tracer of the movement of water and gases through trees. Radon is an established tool for studying water flows and gas exchange in the ocean, estuaries, rivers, soil, and groundwater. Radon, methane, and water fluxes from trees will be simultaneously measured across a wetland-upland gradient to determine whether the methane emitted from trees comes from soil water or is produced within the tree. Soil moisture, water potential, soil methane and radon concentrations, water table height, stomatal conductance, and sap flow will be measured concurrently to delineate the relationships between tree physiology, water flows, and stem gas emissions and to distinguish topographic effects. Field data will be used to develop numerical models that simulate dynamic gas transport through the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum, account for both dissolved gas and bubbles, and include both daytime and nighttime transient water potential gradients and transport. Finally, the results will be scaled up to assess how direct and indirect effects of climate change (e.g., temperature increase, sea level rise, changes in precipitation patterns, soil moisture, and tree water use, shift of some coastal forests from upland to wetland) may affect tree methane emissions.<br/><br/>This award is co-funded by the Hydrologic Sciences and Instrumentation and Facilities programs in the Division of Earth Sciences, as well as the Ecosystem Science program in the Division of Environmental Biology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In cities, humans have intensively reconfigured the landscape and extensively concentrated resources. These urban environs are expected to host almost all future global population growth. If and how cities will remain livable in the future, however, is a critical question.  Key factors of livability include a comfortable environment, access to and efficient use of water, and resilience to extremes of drought, flood, cold, and heat.  Natural science suggests that these factors are strongly related to the vegetation cover, soils, and heat and water balances of a place, but it is an open question how precisely lessons from natural science conducted in rural, natural areas might apply to cities. Among the most prominent, unique characteristics of cities are their extreme spatial variations in land cover (e.g., grass, pavement, trees, gardens, and bare ground juxtaposed over short distances) and the phenomenon called the urban heat island (UHI). An UHI occurs where an urban area is substantially warmer than nearby rural areas due to factors such as greater absorption of solar energy by paved surfaces and less evaporative cooling from dry urban surfaces than rural fields or forests. This project will determine (1) how urban landscape variations, heat, and water balances interact as cause and consequence of local hot or cool microclimates within the city, (2) how microclimates and their vegetative and hydrologic influences relate to urban human health and comfort, and (3) how the overall UHI climate and hydrologic regime of cities may be made more resilient to weather extremes for the benefit of urban infrastructure, urban environmental quality, and urban human safety. To the extent that the linked surface water and energy balances of a city might be controlled by is landscape composition and configuration, with sufficient knowledge of urban heterogeneity-heat-water relations, cities could be engineered for greater health and sustainability, even in the face of global change. <br/><br/>The dual goals of this project are to (1) quantify the links and feedbacks between urban landscape heterogeneity, urban heat, and the urban water cycle and (2) to forge a strong pipeline between science, education, and management to help empower people of all abilities and positions to develop practices to enhance the comfort and resilience of urban landscapes in the face of global change. The research will address how the distributed surface water and energy balances of the urban environment function, whether they function differently in urban heat or cool islands, how they are governed by various types of land cover, and how they in turn affect water resource demands and human comfort. Research approaches will include in situ quantitative monitoring of the heat and water balances of the most common urban land covers subject to the same microclimate island and compared among different microclimates; field, remote sensing, and modeling investigation of urban soil moisture's controls on urban warming; physics-based numerical modeling of urban landscape composition and configuration controls on microclimate, surface energy balance, and surface water balance; and remote sensing and modelling assessments of how progressive urbanization and warming and the scale of data considered may influence the quantifications of urban heat and water cycles. This project will also foster research-education-management synergy with multiple open-access innovations. Urban environmental science field course modules will be developed for a variety of age levels (pre-school to graduate) to foster place-based, experiential, and life-long STEM learning. The modules will also be explicitly designed to make field science accessible to students with mobility needs.

A great deal can be learned about the extremes of strong gravity, about denser-than-nuclei matter, and even about the origin of heavy elements, by studying the collisions of neutron stars with each other or with black holes.  Such a binary system emits gravitational waves as the neutron star and its companion spiral together and electromagnetic waves (visible light, infrared, gamma rays, etc.) after the merger.  Both signals are sometimes detectable and in some cases have been detected. Numerical simulations that include general relativity are the only way to predict how merger processes unfold, and they've gotten pretty good at modeling the merger and the first few hundredths of a second afterward. The post-merger evolution lasts around a couple of seconds.  Although this does not sound long, it is too long to be accessible to 3D numerical simulations, especially because the presence of small-scale turbulent flows makes the grids needed large and the simulations expensive.  This project will probe these later times with numerical relativity, following the story of the merger through to completion, when nothing but a stable, quiescent black hole or neutron star remains.  The problems of large grid and long time requirements will be dealt with by carrying out 2D simulations (using the rough symmetry about a rotation axis) and carefully-designed models of the effect of turbulent flows on scales to small to be directly captured on the 2D grids.  These simulations will include a high degree of realism in the treatment of magnetic fields and neutrino radiation.  The techniques and code developed to carry them out will be applicable to other interesting systems with near-axisymmetry, such as collapsing stars.<br/><br/>This award supports long-time (multi-second) studies of these strong-gravity, dense-matter systems using the Spectral Einstein Code (SpEC), a high-accuracy numerical relativity code that includes magnetohydrodynamics, nuclear microphysics, and neutrino transport. SpEC's 2D radiation magnetohydrodynamics code will be improved to include 2D spacetime evolution, Monte Carlo neutrino transport, and a mean-field/large-eddy incorporation of the effects of turbulence in the azimuthal direction.  Long-time 2D simulations will extend existing compact binary merger simulations for multiple seconds, yielding accurate predictions about disk winds, winds from and possible delayed collapse of a stellar remnant, and GRB energetics. Finally, these numerical techniques will be applied to the first SpEC simulations of black hole formation and growth in a post-collapse, long-duration GRB scenario.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For instance a 1995 heat wave resulted in over 600 deaths in Chicago, and the European heat wave of 2003 claimed more than 50,000 lives.  Heat waves also cause indirect harm by contributing to crop failures, wildfires, droughts, and poor air quality.  Heat wave frequency has increased dramatically over the past decades, accompanying the rise of global mean temperature, and further increases are expected as temperature continues to rise.  Warmer temperatures also lead to more ""concurrent heat waves"", meaning simultaneous heat waves that cover a substantial fraction of the summer hemisphere land surface.<br/><br/>Weather patterns leading to heat waves are easy to identify, commonly involving stagnant high-pressure systems accompanied by clear skies and subsiding air. But more perceptive analysis is required to understand why those weather patterns form, how long they remain in place, and the extent to which maximum temperatures within them are affected by the dryness of the surface or other local effects.  A further consideration is that heat waves are typically identified as prolonged periods of extremely hot weather, but high humidity can matter as much as high temperature for human health effects.  Compared to traditional heat waves the meteorology of humid heat waves is relatively unexplored.<br/><br/>Research conducted here considers the contributions of dynamic and thermodynamic processes to heat waves considering both dry and humid events.  A key consideration is the extent to which heat waves are prolonged and intensified by dry soil, which prevents evaporative cooling of the land surface. Another is the extent to which distinct physical mechanisms lead to dry and humid events, where humid events are defined as extremes of the wet bulb temperature (WBT). WBT is the lowest temperature that can be achieved through evaporative cooling given ambient temperature and moisture.  It is a good indicator of human heat stress as we rely on evaporation of perspiration to avoid heat stress at high temperatures.<br/><br/>One analysis tool is causal effect networks (CENs), a graphical technique borrowed from information theory and machine learning in which causality is established through lagged regression.  Preliminary work using CENs suggests that an early summer heat wave can lead to reduced precipitation, which dries the soil and promotes additional heat waves. The work is performed using a combination of observations and output from climate model simulations of present-day and projected future climate, and model simulations are devised to further test and examine physical mechanisms.<br/><br/>The work is of practical as well as scientific interest given the severe consequences of heat waves as noted above.  Outreach to stakeholders concerned with heat wave impacts is performed through the Consortium for Climate Risk in the Urban Northeast (CCRUN), where one of the researchers has a leadership role.  Interactions with students interested in climate impacts is enabled through the lead researcher's role as Director of the Masters degree granting Climate and Society program at Columbia University. The project also involves a Primarily Undergraduate Institution (PUI), and results are incorporated into undergraduate classroom teaching.  In addition, two graduate students are supported through this award.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These microbiomes are important for human health, clean environments, and productive crops. Since they are much smaller than their hosts, microorganisms can evolve much faster. Within the microbiomes, some theoretical models predict that faster evolution will result in microorganisms that cause more severe disease, whereas other models predict that faster evolution will cause beneficial microorganisms to become even more beneficial. Understanding when each of these outcomes occurs will be important for coming up with strategies to manage microbiomes. This project will use coevolutionary theoretical models to understand how communities of microorganisms that colonize the roots of clover plants interact and evolve. Clover is a relative of many crop plants such as beans, alfalfa, and chickpeas, and this information can be used to improve agricultural yield and soil health. Students will be trained in methods to study these microorganisms and will isolate strains, analyze genomes and physiology, and measure ecological interactions. The project will recruit underserved Native American students in the Pacific Northwest. This project will also produce a coevolutionary video game that will combine outreach and education with research. A symposium bringing together student researchers, empiricists, and theoreticians will catalyze transformative research in this rapidly moving field.<br/><br/>Host-associated microbial communities are key mediators of host traits and ecosystem processes, and a scientific frontier is understanding how these communities interact and coevolve in nature. Clover nodule-associated microorganismal communities are an ideal model system to study these processes. This project has three key elements: (1) an accessible field system at Bodega Bay, amenable to the collection of long-term data on both hosts and associated microorganisms, (2) the ability to bring key players into the lab to measure the molecular basis of host-microorganism and microorganism-microorganism interactions, assess patterns of fitness covariance, and conduct experimental coevolution, and (3) mathematical models that can be parameterized with empirical data to predict community assembly and coevolutionary dynamics. The project will address (1) how asymmetries in evolutionary rates influence coevolution in complex communities, (2) scenarios in which 'Red Queen' dynamics?arms races between antagonists?outpace 'Red King' dynamics, where rapidly-evolving mutualists evolve costly traits that enhance host fitness, and (3) how multi-partite interactions influence host benefit and specialization. By linking empirical measurements over varying evolutionary timescales to mathematical models, this project will potentially generate insight into general properties of complex coevolving host-associated communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There are still many details that scientists do not understand about the underlying mechanisms that enable movement. One challenge in better understanding these mechanisms arises from the vast number of inter-connected processes that contribute to musculoskeletal function. The proposed research aims to identify and characterize two biological mechanisms of coupling, between the molecular and tissue levels, within this system. Computer models and mechanical-feedback experiments will be used to test whether dynamic responses between muscles and their tendons lead to greater force and power output as muscles contract. Addressing two specific mechanisms herein will lay the groundwork to diversify this approach and cross-examine other, complementary mechanisms that enable movement in future studies. Expected outcomes will advance knowledge and better define how skeletal muscles generate force and power output, and how the muscle-tendon interface helps produce movement. Findings will influence fields ranging from rehabilitation and sports medicine to the design of robotic systems and comparative biomechanics. Outreach activities will expand the inclusion of Native American populations in STEM fields and increase the diversity of the technical workforce. These latter activities will be guided by the local Tribal Nations and focus on musculoskeletal health, with events on campus and mentoring undergraduates to perform research in the lab. Formal assessment plans will help evaluate the depth of scientific impact, outreach, and engagement with the students.<br/><br/>Many mechanisms may augment the function of skeletal muscle, as a motor, to produce a rich variety of movements. This includes processes underlying muscle work and power output, and effects of tendons, musculoskeletal geometry, and inertia of the body. These mechanisms are intrinsically coupled, where behavior of one component influences behavior of another component, creating a multi-scale feedback system. The impacts of these mechanisms on movement are poorly understood because studying different mechanisms in isolation neglects the coupling between them. The proposed study aims to elucidate the relative importance of two coupled mechanisms that likely increase muscle work production: i) length-dependent cross-bridge kinetics, and ii) variable muscle gearing. Research will investigate individual and combined effects of these mechanisms via expanded computational models, and a newly developed hybrid experimental-simulation feedback system that couples muscle mechanics, muscle morphology, tendon properties, and inertia. These new approaches will enable manipulation of biophysical, biochemical, and mechanical mechanisms of muscle contraction across multiple scales. The findings will advance understanding of the relative contribution of these two mechanisms on skeletal muscle?s ability to better generate work and produce organismal movement.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, data from sensor feeds, information databases about events, supply chains, and web traffic are relational by nature and require graph-based representations. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) will allow the analysis to uncover hidden patterns from the data and can enable these applications for making predictions and decision support. Training machine learning (ML) models at the edge (training on-chip or on embedded systems) can address many pressing challenges, including data privacy/security, increase the accessibility of ML applications to different parts of the world by reducing the dependence on the communication fabric and the cloud infrastructure, and meet the real-time requirements of augmented/virtual reality (AR/VR) applications. Many applications including AR/VR require GNN training on embedded systems. However, existing edge platforms do not have sufficient capabilities to support on-device training of GNNs. Moreover, it is estimated that training a single unpruned neural network on conventional compute platforms, such as GPUs, can cost over $10,000 and emit as much carbon as five cars over their lifetimes. Resistive random-access memory (ReRAM) based processing-in-memory (PIM) architectures are a promising solution to address this problem. The crossbar structure of ReRAM-based architectures enables efficient Matrix-Vector Multiplication (MVM) operations, which are ubiquitous in modern ML tasks including GNN training/inference. We use ReRAM as an example, but the proposed computing framework will work equally well for any other crossbar-based PIM configuration. The educational contribution of this work lies in the establishment of an interdisciplinary research-based curriculum integrating PIM, machine learning, and data-driven design optimization. The proposed research will enhance the education of students by enabling them to apply classroom knowledge to research problems that require hardware, software, and theoretical expertise. The PIs have many years of accumulated experience in involving underrepresented groups in research. This experience will be leveraged to motivate and engage students from underrepresented groups, including women, African Americans, and Hispanics.<br/><br/> In this project, we lay the foundations for a novel and reliable computing framework for GNN computation using PIM-based manycore systems. With the rising needs of GNN-based applications from the edge to the cloud, we need computing systems to meet the stringent size, weight, and power (SWaP) constraints. The key contribution of this research will be the conceptual development, optimization, and evaluation of high-performance, energy-efficient, and reliable PIM-based architectures for GNN computing. Despite the exponential growth in interest and extensive research and application studies on GNN-based data analytics, the importance of hardware-assisted execution efficiency and hardware-aware algorithm efficiency has not received adequate attention. This research will reduce the dependency on data centers and high-performance computing (HPC) clusters for executing GNN-based applications. There is a lack of holistic solutions that allow us to quickly design and optimize PIM-enabled computing platforms for GNNs. Hence, machine learning enabled hardware and software co-design optimization strategies proposed in this work will have profound impacts on computing platforms where GNNs are increasingly deployed. There is a growing set of edge ML applications that are enabled by deploying GNNs on mobile platforms or embedded systems. Since mobile/embedded platforms are constrained by both compute and storage, there is a great need for PIM-based solutions to deploy GNNs for edge ML applications. More computational power at the edge will reduce both the internet traffic and power-hungry processing at data centers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Increases in global air temperatures and ice-sheet mass loss are driving sea level rise around the globe. Meanwhile, as the Arctic melts, maritime and commercial activities in the region are expanding, presenting new opportunities, as well as societal and cultural challenges. As Arctic regions are largely inaccessible to traditional observation techniques, satellite remote sensing systems play a key role in monitoring their essential climate variables. However, the unprecedented volume and variety of geospatial big data collected by new satellites have reached far beyond the capacity of computing platforms accessible to most geoscientists. This gap between data growth and data discovery capacity significantly undermines the value of emerging big datasets. Moreover, most existing software for geospatial big data do not offer advanced analytical capabilities to facilitate geoscience discoveries. The project aims to remove these barriers by developing a low-cost and large-scale system, namely ICESpark, to seamlessly support the lifecycle of big data enabled geoscience research in the New Arctic and beyond. The results may improve the well-being of citizens by addressing key climate change questions, including extreme events, natural disasters, sea-level rise, drought, and wildfires. It will also improve science and engineering education via development of new course materials, cross-training of students from computing and geosciences fields, as well as an ICESpark webinar series.<br/><br/>ICESpark is a distributed platform that can combine local commodity computers into a powerful environment that is ready for geospatial big data (GeoBD). Built on Apache Sedona, ICESpark first develops data integration and cleaning tools to harness a wide variety of GeoBD across geoscience domains including oceanography, cryospheric science and ecology. Moreover, ICESpark provides a scalable data discovery layer to efficiently identify all coincidental data across streams from heterogeneous sensing platforms (e.g., ICESat-2, Jason-3, Sentinel-3, GEDI) under various conditions. Third, ICESpark offers advanced data analytics capabilities, including a geo-feature identification system and a geo-pattern mining package, to equip geoscientists with geophysical or statistical tools to examine complex relationships and patterns embedded in GeoBD. To enhance research infrastructure, ICESpark will provide a variety of pre-packed front-ends including Jupyter notebooks as well as interoperation with EarthCube?s QGreenland, improving the accessibility to the system across broad disciplinary communities. The system will also be open-sourced and follow the EarthCube GeoCODES Dataset schema for long-term sustainability.

Kangaroo rats construct elaborate burrows over multiple years and occupy them for extended periods of time. The burrows remain open and stable in desert sand and survive the harsh desert conditions, with extreme daily and yearly relative humidity and temperature fluctuations and flash-flood events. This research tests the hypothesis that the burrow microbiome is determined by the microbial community in cheek pouches or feet of kangaroo rats and that biofilms formed in this microbiome (i.e., burrow biofilms) are crucial to burrow stability in stochastic, fluctuating desert environments. The fundamental understanding gained from this project could translate to the design of sustainable ground improvement techniques to be used in geotechnical engineering practice, particularly in locations prone to landslides and substrate collapse. The research will establish direct collaborations among researchers, graduate students, and undergraduate students in geotechnical and geoenvironmental engineering, bioengineering, and biology. <br/> <br/>The research will specifically test the hypotheses that (i) the suction stress characteristic curve of burrow-biofilm-enhanced desert soil is a non-monotonic function of saturation, due to water retention by both the soil and the biofilm, and contributes to effective stress regardless of the extreme fluctuations in humidity, saturation, and temperature, to maintain the stability of the burrows and (ii) biofilms reduce the hydraulic conductivity of burrow ceilings, and therefore prevent flooding of the burrows during storms. The experimental program will include growing the burrow biofilms in the laboratory and determining the strength of burrow-biofilm-enhanced soil over the entire range of saturation and after multiple wet/dry and heat/cool cycles. The research will also investigate how water retention by the cementing agent (i.e., burrow biofilm) contributes to suction stress to maintain burrow stability under extreme fluctuations in environmental conditions. This is important for establishing the mechanistic basis for stability in sandy soils in arid environments. In addition, the research will study how the hydraulic conductivity of desert sand changes with the addition of burrow biofilm. Results from this research will reveal how one of the most prolific ecosystem engineers digs complex, stable, and sustainable underground environments in desert sand and how an individual?s phenotype extends from their microbiome, to burrow site selection, and more broadly to landscape biogeomorphology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although writing is a critical skill for engineers, employers frequently complain that engineering graduates need better writing skills.  Undergraduate engineering curricula typically require various general education writing courses early in the program of study. However, engineering educators often do not have the tools to connect students' learning from early writing courses to their writing in engineering courses. The goal of this project is to improve the transfer of writing skills from college writing courses into engineering courses.  To accomplish this goal, the project will develop an instructional module to facilitate transfer of writing skills from writing courses into the laboratory component of engineering courses.  It will also evaluate whether the instructional module enhances student writing of engineering lab reports. This project expands on a previous project that demonstrated success in this approach at one institution.  In this follow-on study, the writing module will be further refined and implemented at multiple institutions.  The partnering institutions were chosen because of differences in the general education writing course requirements for their engineering students.  Thus, this research study could identify writing instruction strategies that are transferable across different types of institutions.  <br/><br/>This Engaged Student Learning project will identify what transferable knowledge students bring from three far-transfer models: concurrent transfer in which students build on first year composition and technical writing courses; vertical transfer in which students have only completed first year composition; and absent transfer in which students have completed a literary course but lack both technical writing and the preparation in composition that is characteristic of first year composition. The collaboration includes at least one institution representing each of the three models, enabling exploration of two key research questions: ""How can writing transfer be adapted across the US to a wide range of writing curricula in lower-division courses?"" and ""How can a transfer-focused writing module be implemented effectively in diverse engineering lab classrooms taught by any instructor?"" Informed by a mapping of students' collective zone of proximal development, a lab report instructional module will be refined by adapting multiple scaffolds to support students' incremental engagement with lab report writing as engaged disciplinary learning. The module will include direct instructional materials and reference materials as supports for writing lab reports. The project will conduct quantitative and qualitative assessment of students' lab report writing as disciplinary meaning making, as well as students' development of technical communication skills. Results from this integrated mixed methods approach has the potential to advance knowledge about the impact of transfer-focused writing pedagogies on students' lab report writing competencies. This project is based on results from an exploratory project that showed statistically significant improvements in engineering students' lab report quality after implementing a writing transfer-focused lab report module at two institutions utilizing a vertical transfer model. These results suggest that a student-centered pedagogical approach that explicitly reinforces writing knowledge and skills from prior post-secondary writing experiences can be more productive than the traditional case study approach often employed in engineering writing instruction. With these encouraging prior results, the results of this project have the potential to be applicable to diverse engineering laboratory course settings across diverse engineering curricula.  This project is supported by the NSF Improving Undergraduate STEM Education Program: Education and Human Resources.  This program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students.  Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Questions about the formation and evolution of stable continents during Earth?s earliest history have been vigorously debated in the literature for over 50 years and continue to be a focus of current research. Archean rocks (those older than 2.5 billion years) represent nearly half of Earth?s history, but only occur in a few areas on the continents. Rocks from the Paleoarchean (3.6 to 3.2 billion years) and Eoarchean (4.0 to 3.6 billion years) are considerably more rare and represent only a small percentage of all preserved Archean rocks worldwide. These Paleoarchean and older rocks represent windows into the early Earth and the formation, nature, and evolution of the ancient continents. This proposal seeks to study the record of crustal formation, modification, and stabilization of the Zimbabwe and São Francisco (Brazil) cratons, two of the best preserved and exposed fragments of Paleoarchean continental crust on Earth. The study of the early Earth, as well as questions regarding the time and processes involved in the initiation of modern plate tectonics, have been included as a priority in several community-based documents, including the ?Challenges & Opportunities for Research in Tectonics? (Huntington & Klepeis, 2018) and, ?A vision for NSF Earth Sciences 2020-2030: Earth in time? report of the NSF (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine 2020). The integrated approach taken in this proposal will enhance the geographic coverage of studies on Archean cratons and improve the record from the earliest history of the Earth and will contribute to the understanding of the whole picture of the early Earth. This proposal will also contribute to the building of a more diverse geoscience community by supporting women in science with one PhD Latinx student. Collaboration with Brazilian and South African colleagues is an integral part of this research project. <br/><br/><br/>This research proposal seeks to integrate isotope geochemistry and geochronology to study the 3.65-2.70 Ga Zimbabwe and São Francisco (SF) cratons, two important Archean terranes that have received relatively little attention despite their extensive Archean geological record. The Zimbabwe and SF cratons are two of the best preserved and exposed portions of unmodified Paleoarchean continental crust on Earth. These cratons also preserved dome and keel structures, archetypal of Archean crust. The aim of this research is to constrain the evolution of the central portion of the Zimbabwe craton and the Gavião block and gneiss complexes from the northern and southern SF craton. The approach in this research is to: 1) determine the timescale of crust formation through the Paleoarchean in these areas; 2) determine the Hf and Nd isotope record of these cratons and how they have evolved through time; and 3) evaluate the Lu-Hf and Sm-Nd isotope systematics of the gneiss complexes to determine if they have faithfully recorded and preserved their initial isotope compositions. This work will be done using an integrated approach of in-situ U-Pb age and Lu-Hf/Sm-Nd isotope analysis of zircon, titanite, and other REE-rich accessory phases, combined with solution Lu-Hf and Sm-Nd isotope dilution analyses of bulk rock samples. Where possible, garnet Lu-Hf and Sm-Nd geochronology?in conjunction with age and isotope data from accessory phases?will be used to document post-magmatic tectono-thermal events. This integrated geochemical and geochronological approach will provide a timeframe of crust formation events and a robust Hf and Nd isotope record of the Zimbabwe and SF cratons. This, ultimately, will help the community to evaluate processes of crust formation, modification, and stabilization in the Paleoarchean?a pivotal time in Earth?s crustal evolution. This proposed research represents a continuation of the work that has been done by the PI, students, and post-docs in Greenland, in the Acasta Gneiss Complex, and what has been done (and is still ongoing) in the Pilbara Craton of NW Australia.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A new class of ceramics are high entropy ceramics (HECs), which are multicomponent materials containing more than five principal elements.  When those elements are heavy atoms, HECs can show unique physical properties and high thermal stability, making them promising materials as a protective coating for a range of technologies such as sustainable energy and national security.   This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) project pursues fundamental research to provide the needed knowledge for the technical development of HECs.  An outstanding scientific problem in HECs is how do the randomness of elements in the structure (related to entropy) and their bonding (related to energy) control the mixing of these different elements and thereby affect their high-temperature performance? To address this challenge, this research focuses on determining thermodynamic descriptions of HECs to understand and predict their behavior in real-world applications. Specialized instrumentations are used to measure the stability and strength of chemical bonds as well as probe the arrangement of atoms in these solids. The predictive models generated from this project should accelerate materials discovery of new HECs. This CAREER project also aims to educate and inspire younger people in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, from high school to undergraduate and graduate students.  The education activities include engaging students in advanced experimental and modeling methods that prepares them for future professions in STEM fields. Outreach activities include summer schools for high school students to increase their scientific interests in ceramic and thermodynamic sciences. <br/><br/>Technical Summary<br/><br/>The f-block HECs are gaining increased attention for their enhanced stabilities, tunable functions, and unique chemical and physical properties. However, the lack of structural and thermodynamic models that describe the mixing of multiple elements significantly impedes the development and design of HECs.  Principal elements are often assumed to follow a random distribution (ideal mixing). Due to the differences in size, charge, and covalency, non-ideal mixing can enhance enthalpic interactions but attenuate entropic contributions. Misinterpretation of thermodynamics of mixing can lead to an inaccurate prediction of material formation, order-disorder transition, and phase stability. This CAREER project focuses on developing a structural and thermodynamic understanding of the mixing effects of various 4f and 5f elements in HECs and their impacts on thermodynamic stability under high temperatures. This research project addresses three knowledge gaps to achieve accurate thermodynamic descriptions of HECs: i) the limited understanding of non-ideal enthalpic interaction, ii) the inaccurate estimation of configurational entropy, and iii) their unknown temperature-dependencies under high temperatures. To close these gaps, this research begins with f-block HECs and pursues two synergistic objectives: i) to measure the enthalpic effects of mixing and determine the origins and controlling factors of any non-ideal thermodynamic effects, and ii) to determine and correlate entropic terms with enthalpy for a complete thermodynamic description of f-block HECs. These results will reveal the thermodynamic drivers for phase formation and transformation at elevated temperatures. The outreach activities feature a summer research opportunity for high school students to deepen their scientific interests in ceramic and thermodynamic sciences. The educational component includes advanced X-ray spectroscopy to undergraduate and graduate students using a lab-based light source instead of a synchrotron and the integration of advanced ceramic thermodynamics modeling into the graduate curriculum.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the future of construction work is at crossroads. First, productivity in construction work has been stagnant relative to other industries (e.g., manufacturing), and the industry has historically been slow to adopt innovations that affect efficiency. Second, it has been difficult to offset the aging and retiring workforce with younger and more diverse workers, causing the workforce supply to fall short of rising demand. This is mainly because construction work tends to be physically strenuous leading to occupational hazards that often force workers to retire early. Robotization has been suggested as a potential solution to these problems. However, the unstructured nature of construction work presents several technical, social and economic impediments that hinder the direct adoption and integration of such innovations by the construction industry. For construction workers, robotic technology can only be transformative if it allows them to channel their passion for the work while avoiding the chronic pain and health outcomes associated with its physical demands.<br/><br/>This project investigates if construction work can be conceived as a human-robot partnership, where human workers play the critical role of planning the work, and training and supervising robotic assistants to adapt to presented workspace conditions and perform useful work. The project team is integrating advances in interactive task learning, mixed reality, and reinforcement learning to enable construction workers to naturally collaborate with robot assistants through direct physical interaction and virtual supervision and training. For such a symbiotic human-robot partnership to benefit construction workers and result in widespread deployment, workers need to be equipped with new skills. The project team is exploring new educational and professional development programs to support worker aspirations for upskilling and lifelong learning, and to open avenues for people of diverse abilities to be productive members of the construction workforce. Tight-knit partnerships with industry collaborators will inform the project activities and provide access to construction work sites and training facilities for testing and evaluation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cancer immunotherapies have shown great promise and efficacy in clinical trial studies, with seven being approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA); However, manufacturing these cells remains a limiting factor in widespread adoption. Current FDA-approved therapies require up to 250 million immune cells per infusion, with costs for a single dose nearing $500,000. The current manufacturing limitations underscore the urgent need for innovation in cell manufacturing. Prior research with an animal model shows this solution can reduce the manufacturing time for cell therapies by 30% in comparison to the fastest technology on the market. Using this technology, manufacturing directors at biopharmaceutical companies may be able to save space in their facilities and save money on labor and cell culture resources while clinicians at cancer centers are able to treat patients at a faster rate. By addressing time and resource limitations, the technology has the potential to reduce the financial barrier to lifesaving cell therapies, increasing adoption by cancer patients. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a centrifugal fluidized expansion perfusion bioreactor prototype. The bioreactor streamlines the cell expansion process by balancing centrifugal forces with a continuous feed of fresh medium to remove inhibitory waste products and retain cells unlike current solutions. Early research has shown that immune cells from cattle can be expanded, and that the prototype can sustain high cell population densities over 100 million cells/mL, reducing manufacturing time from 7-14 days to 5 days, and maintaining cell growth at 95% of the maximum rate. Moreover, unlike current manufacturing equipment, the bioreactor fits easily on a standard lab bench and is entirely self-contained, with its housing acting as a standalone unit with air filters and ultraviolet-c sterilization?eliminating the need for multi-million dollar cleanrooms. Findings from prior research support the potential impact the device would have on scalability and accessibility of cancer cell therapies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In addition to their great concern for human health, EIDs are now a leading cause of biodiversity declines. A well-known example is a lethal, transmissible cancer that threatens Tasmanian devils with extinction. Typical of infectious diseases, the host evolves to resist the pathogen. In turn, the pathogen is pressured to evolve to overcome new host defenses. Indeed, long-term data show that devils and their tumors are evolving in response to one another, but the genetic pathways by which they respond remain poorly described. The goal of this research is to determine whether the genetic pathways underlying adaptive changes in devils, such as increased survival once infected, are similar or different among devil populations infected for different lengths of time. Similarly, the tumor has adapted, and tests of repeatability of tumor genetic evolution in time and space will also be conducted. The implications of this work are far reaching. If, for example, genetic pathways are similar among populations, then conservation and treatment options can be generalized. Conversely, if genetic pathways are different, treatment options may need to be tailored, with different treatments for different populations. Regardless, the work will lead to improved conservation and management of the iconic Tasmanian devil. Additionally, the Tasmanian devil cancer evolves quite similarly to human cancer, providing a unique opportunity to track tumor evolution in a natural population.<br/><br/>One of the biggest challenges in the life sciences today is unraveling the genotype-phenotype relationship. Rapid global change necessitates assessments of species? capacity to adapt and whether adaptive evolution is repeatable to guide appropriate management strategies. Owing to the polygenic nature of most phenotypic traits, this is a formidable task. However, virulent EIDs can levy intense selection pressure on multiple host populations as they spread, offering a way to test patterns of repeatability in host-pathogen evolution. Tasmanian devils and their lethal transmissible cancer are a model system for such tests. The east-to-west progression of disease emergence across Tasmania has created a natural experiment. Different devil populations have been infected for different numbers of generations and are at different evolutionary stages of disease progression. Thousands of phenotypic measurements of diseased and healthy devils, along with extensive tissue sampling of devil-tumor pairs, will enable robust tests of molecular signatures of (co)evolution. Genome scans and evolutionary concordance analyses will be used test whether the genomic architecture underlying adaptive phenotypic traits in devils and tumors are repeatable in time (i.e., across different stages of disease emergence) and space (i.e., across different populations). If concordant, the underlying mechanism (e.g., soft selective sweeps, hard sweeps or gene flow) will be tested.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In response to the calls set forth by the Framework for K-12 Science Education and Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), the field has most successfully researched and developed assessment tools for disciplinary core ideas and the science and engineering practices. The CCCs, which serve as the connective links across science domains, however, remain more abstractly addressed. Presently, science educators have little guidance for what student use of CCCs looks like or how to assess and nurture such use. This project, with its explicit attention to the CCCs, advances true three-dimensional scientific understanding in both research and the classroom. Leveraging formative assessment as a vehicle for student and teacher development taps into proven successful instructional strategies (e.g., sharing visions of successful learning, descriptive feedback, self-assessment), while also advancing formative assessment, itself, by strengthening and illustrating how these strategies may focus on the CCCs. Further, a strengths-based approach will center culturally related differences in students? use of CCCs to achieve more equitable opportunities to engage in classroom sensemaking practices. This work impacts the field of science education by 1) enabling a more thorough realization of NGSS ideals, 2) strengthening teachers? abilities to identify diverse demonstrations of CCCs, and 3) showcasing the impact of novel classroom tools to sharpen teachers? abilities to solicit, notice, and act upon evidence of emergent student scientific thinking within their instructional practices. <br/><br/>This design-based implementation research project will engage teachers in the iterative development and refinement of rubrics that support three-dimensional science understanding through formative assessment. The high school biology classrooms that compose the study site are engaged in ambitious science teaching-inspired instruction. An inductive, bottom-up approach (Brookhart, 2013) will allow researchers, teachers, and students to co-construct rubrics. Analysis of classroom observations, artifact collection, interviews with teachers and students, and expert-panel ratings will produce a rubric for each CCC that integrates relevant science and engineering practices and is applicable across a range of disciplinary core ideas. These rubrics will illustrate progressions of increasingly advanced use of each of the CCCs, to guide the construction, pursuit, and assessment of learning goals. There will be two design cycles that allow for the collection of validity evidence and produce rubrics with the potential for broad application by educators. Complementary lines of qualitative and quantitative (i.e., psychometric) analysis will contribute to development and validation of the rubrics and their formative uses. Project inquiry will focus on 1) how the rubrics can represent CCCs for key disciplinary practices, 2) the extent to which teachers? and students? understandings of the rubrics align, and 3) how implementation of the rubrics impacts teachers? and students? understandings of the CCCs.<br/><br/>The Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools.

However, fully characterizing or understanding all the complex processes that occur within watersheds is often not feasible and prohibitively costly. Many locations of concern simply do not have enough long-term data to predict how solutes will be transported through watersheds, and lack the time and money required to make such predictions. The purpose of this project is to develop a framework whereby better predictions of solute transport can be made, even in data scarce regions. The project leverages existing data and high-resolution models, constructed at sites that have already been characterized in great detail, to assess how flow and transport processes in similar watersheds are related. This information will lead to simple statistical models that can capture the complexity of real watersheds based on less detailed characterizations. The models are expected to allow the translation of knowledge from sites where great investments have been made to improve models of relatively data-poor sites. The project is also creating new educational tools, training undergraduate and graduate students, and reaching out to applied watershed managers to better understand their needs for real-world applications of solute transport models.  <br/><br/>The approach used in this research focuses on using recent multi-domain correlated velocity models (MD-CVMs) to represent coupled subsurface and surface flow and transport in watersheds. Lagrangian particle-based numerical methods along streamtubes are the core of this approach, which couples interactions between particles to accurately represent crucial mixing and reaction processes. The water and solutes from each streamtube interact as they come together, simplifying the watershed geometry into a tree without sacrificing process-level realism. The streamtube approach will also enforce velocity correlations, which is a novel feature at watershed scales that is lacking in previous models despite evidence that persistent correlations exist. The advantage of using velocity correlations is that they are conceptually simple but yield robust models that show promise across different sites. The resulting dynamically coupled, yet realistic, representations of watersheds will expand the tools available for understanding and optimally managing real watersheds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Like cellular sentries, receptor-like kinases have crucial functions in sensing and orchestrating responses to environmental cues. Kinases perceive molecular signals from other organisms (like pathogens) or from neighboring cells and pass signals along to other proteins to initiate defense responses or other changes, such as halting growth. Consistent with the importance of these functions, kinases are one of the most abundant plant protein families; however, kinases have also proven to be difficult to study. New advances in both understanding and technology will be used in this project to enable matching of plant kinases to the signals that they detect and to the downstream ?recipients? of the information, thereby revealing the function of these proteins. Improvements in knowledge of kinases will open new avenues for improving plant production for food, feed, fiber, and energy. In addition, the project will train at least five young scientists to use advanced technologies and will provide plant science educational opportunities to ~60 teachers via professional development workshops, introduce ~30 Native American high school and undergraduate students to research via week-long plant signaling research project workshops, and provide ~40 summer and academic year undergraduate research opportunities that meld plant and data science.<br/><br/>This research will characterize the functions and substrates of receptor-like kinases (RLKs) of Arabidopsis, rice, and soybean. Objective 1 aims to reveal RLK functions by combing quantification of phosphorylation and S-acylation (e.g., palmitoylation) as indicators of involvement of an RLK in a biological process. This analysis will take advantage of new results that suggest that these posttranslational modifications are antagonistic. The project will use proteomics technology to deeply and quantitatively sample total and plasma membrane-enriched proteins during rice internode development, with and without drought stress; and soybean and rice root responses to conserved putative small secreted peptides. The relatively well-understood Arabidopsis- Pseudomonas syringae interaction will be examined to optimize methods. The focus on peptide hormone ligands and root growth will survey broadly across predicted small secreted peptide families. Objective 2 takes a complementary approach to revealing RLK function, by creating deep (12k) peptide libraries for each species and screening them against purified protein kinases with the goal of identifying kinase clients for at least 25 novel kinases. The kinase client assay accelerates assignment of downstream signaling and its usefulness has been demonstrated by rapid community adoption. In Objective 3, experimental results will be extended using machine learning approaches to predict plant phosphorylation sites and specific kinase clients.

The experimental efforts utilize advanced electron microscopy and multi-functional scanning probe microscopy techniques, such as tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy and various atomic force microscopy-based measurements with high spatial and temporal resolutions, to probe local properties in individual domain walls. Complementing these experimental investigations, density-functional-theory calculations are used to determine the crystal lattices, electronic and phonon structures, as well as charge carrier transport properties and dynamics in domain walls.

The nitrogen is generally taken up from the soil and then used to produce amino acids. These amino acids play highly diverse and essential roles in plants. They are the basic units of proteins and enzymes, and thereby fundamental to cellular structure and metabolism. Moreover, they are crucial for the synthesis of a large variety of compounds, such as chlorophyll, vitamins and other products needed for plant function as well as for human nutrition. In addition, amino acids serve as signaling molecules triggering physiological processes including plant responses to environmental stresses, and they present the main long-distance nitrogen forms transported to seeds for growth. This project intends to provide pioneering insights on the mechanisms of amino acid partitioning within the cell and their importance for leaf and seed development, and plant survival. It is expected to discover strategies on how amino acid movement can be manipulated to alter nitrogen supply into specific metabolic and transport pathways, with consequences for plant growth, productivity and responses to environmental stresses. The activities will further promote student teaching and training, and foster effective integration of plant biology education and research.<br/><br/>A fundamental process in plants is the selective partitioning of amino acids among different organelles, cells, tissues and organs. Various transport mechanisms must exist within the cell to accommodate their directional transport, and these mechanisms must be coordinated and regulated at different levels to achieve normal physiological functions. In Arabidopsis, more than 100 putative amino acid transporters have been identified but physiological functions in nitrogen transport have only been demonstrated for relatively few transporters, and these are mainly plasma membrane-localized. This project intends to identify novel subcellular amino acid transporters and resolve their substrate specificity and mechanisms of transport. Plants, in which the transporters are knocked-out, knocked-down or overexpressed will be analyzed using molecular, cell-biological and biochemical approaches to unravel the physiological functions of the membrane proteins and their importance for plant growth and development. Finally, amino acids have been shown to play important roles in plant performance under environmental stress conditions. The transporter mutants or overexpressors will be exposed to abiotic stresses and their responses will be examined. Together, this project will help to resolve the function of intracellular membrane transporters and their role in nitrogen partitioning between cellular compartments to promote source leaf function, and in long distance amino acid transport in support of seed development. Evidence will be found on how specific amino acid transporters interconnect nitrogen and carbon metabolism, and other biochemical pathways, and if and how they influence plant responses to abiotic stress.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The interdisciplinary research team includes experts in physiology, behavior, and ecology who will quantitatively evaluate connections between the individual and population, advancing our knowledge of the effects of human activity on nature across multiple fields. The team embodies the IntBIO program mission by incorporating different sub-disciplines and levels of biological organization using a holistic, integrated approach. The research is the first to rigorously evaluate and link physiological, behavioral, and fitness responses to sensory pollution, and does so across several species and multiple sensory stressors for greater generalizability. The project aims to (i) reveal whether noise and light pollution consistently select for a similar phenotype across six bird species; (ii) identify generalizable relationships between physiological, behavioral, and ecological responses, if they exist, and, if not, (iii) unveil key differences among species that underlie sensitivity to these widespread forms of global change. In doing so, the project will build a testable framework for generalizing avian response to human-caused sensory pollution, which can be used to predict whether species will fail or thrive in an increasingly bright and noisy human-dominated world. Project impacts have important societal benefits to conservation and education, with efforts spanning (a) culturally responsive training of underrepresented minorities in STEM to become integrated, early-career biologists, (b) developing and disseminating outreach materials via hands-on outreach events and presentations across large networks, and (c) informing policy through collaboration with the National Park Service and the International Dark-Sky Association.<br/><br/>This project addresses three integrative questions that require expertise from different sub-disciplines to answer: 1) Do sensory stressors shape a generalizable phenotype? 2) Do phenotypes of behavior and physiology affect ultimate outcomes of fitness? and 3) How do combined multi-sensory stressors affect organisms across biological scales? Across gradients and combinations of light and noise, at the proximate level the team will measure (a) physiology (e.g., glucocorticoids, melatonin, testosterone, hormone receptors, clock genes), and (b) behaviors of nesting birds (e.g., aggression, boldness, song structure, settlement, movement). At the ultimate level, they will monitor (c) fitness outcomes via offspring success (e.g., clutch size, fledgling survival) to measure singular and combined consequences of light and noise pollution. The researchers will focus on six songbirds that vary in life history traits and anthropogenic tolerance, increasing our understanding beyond single-species approaches. Importantly, the direct and indirect links among responses will be analyzed using structural equation models, facilitating integration to reveal whether proximate and ultimate relationships are generalizable across species.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is made possible in large part by their capacity to learn from others. Furthermore, human adaptation arises in contexts without formal education. In many societies where education arsies informally, children acquire critical skills and relevant knowledge rapidly and beginning at an early age. This project examines from whom and how children and adolescents learn complex skills and knowledge in contexts lacking formal education. The study considers how a child?s age, gender, cultural ideas about what children can and cannot do at particular ages, and cultural values impact from whom and how children learn. The research project disseminates its findings to academics, policymakers, and the general public to expand the understanding of the diverse ways by which children learn and how these insights might be incorporated into formal education systems. The project also provides research and training opportunities to graduate students in scientific cultural anthropology.  <br/><br/>Specifically, this doctoral dissertation project weighs theoretical debates about learning without formal education in culturally distinct neighboring communities within contexts in which intercultural marriages are commonplace versus rare. It addresses whether these contexts affect whether knowledge is transmitted from parent to child, from peer to peer, or from unrelated teachers. It further tests whether learning is biased according to content, commonness, or to prestige of the teacher. The investigators use a variety of semi-structured parental and child interviews as well as behavioral observational techniques to provide systematically acquired qualitative and quantitative data to address theoretical debates that are frequently abstract. In doing so, the research project contributes to a key area of scientific anthropological inquiry that currently lacks sufficient empirical evidence to weigh among alternative models of social learning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While there is much known about plastics pollution in marine ecosystems, little is known about fate and transport of micro- and nanoplastics in terrestrial systems. Micro- and nanoplastics may be held up in soil, thereby negatively impacting soil organisms, or they may move through soil, potentially contaminating groundwater and drinking water resources. This project aims to characterize the fate of micro- and nanoplastics in terrestrial systems, so that the environmental hazards posed by micro- and nanoplastics can be assessed. Plastic particles in soil will be tracked over time to determine whether their chemical properties change and how they move.<br/><br/>Four commonly used plastics will be used: polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, and a typical biodegradable plastic. The plastics will be subjected to environmental weathering by exposing them to UV and rainfall. Micro- and nanoplastics will then be thoroughly characterized for size, shape, and surface and colloidal properties. It is expected that the weathered micro- and nanoscale plastics particles form an ""eco-corona"", i.e., a covering with extracellular substances, soil organic matter, and clay minerals, which makes the particles more hydrophilic and mobile in soils. Surface and colloidal properties of the plastics will be characterized. Further, transport of the plastics in soils and groundwater will be quantified to determine whether micro- and nanoplastics are held up in soils or aquifers. The specific objectives of this project are to (1) understand the creation of secondary micro- and nanoplastics during weathering, (2) determine the role of weathering on the surface and colloidal properties of micro- and nanoplastics, and (3) identify the fundamental mechanisms involved in transport of micro- and nanoplastics in unsaturated porous media and soils. The project will provide mechanistic information on mobility of micro- and nanoplastics under saturated and unsaturated flow conditions. The project will also provide valuable information for policy makers on the degradation of biodegradable plastics in terrestrial environments. Biodegradable plastics are a promising alternative to conventional plastics, particularly for single-use applications.

Over 85% of the 325,000 flowering plant species on the planet depend on animal pollination and the vast majority is carried out by bees. In the U.S.A. alone bees are responsible for the commercial production of 130 crop plants, generating over $11 billion in annual revenue. The value of bees to nature and human well-being is abundantly clear. The partnership between bees and flowering plants formed over 100 million years ago, and since that time, bees have radiated globally into an astounding 20,000+ different species, many of which are specialist pollinators of particular plant species or families. The study of bee biodiversity is urgently needed because there is growing evidence that some bee species are in decline and baseline knowledge of bee diversity, distribution, and family relationships is incomplete. The Bees of the World project has the potential to significantly improve knowledge of bee biodiversity and to establish a guide to interpret key traits of bees, such as their host-plant associations. By utilizing recent advances in DNA sequencing technology, a comprehensive tree-of-life for bees will be generated for the first time, providing a framework from which to study bee diversity and their relationships with plants. To disseminate results and general bee knowledge, the project will engage in multiple outreach efforts with professional and non-professional audiences. Activities include creation of a virtual bee course, teaching of a molecular methods workshop, and, in collaboration with the Natural History Museum of Utah, development of exhibits and youth education activities focused on pollinators.<br/><br/>The project will use cutting edge molecular and analytical methods and engage a global network of collaborators to assemble a comprehensive phylogenomic dataset for bees. The project aims are to: (1) resolve remaining uncertainties in higher-level bee phylogeny and classification, (2) incorporate fossils to reconstruct the global biogeographic history of bees, revealing the origin and spread of bee diversity over time, and (3) analyze patterns of host-plant use across bees and for targeted clades at lower taxonomic levels, revealing how host-plant specialization has evolved and impacted rates of diversification in bees. To resolve the phylogeny of bees with improved confidence, the research team will use next-generation DNA sequencing approaches and novel laboratory methods to sequence bee species from across the globe. The project will generate low coverage genomes for most bee genera and ultraconserved element (UCE) data for over 3,000 species, filling in sampling gaps. The resulting bee phylogeny will serve as a framework to study bee classification, biogeography, and host-plant evolution. Comprehensive databases of bee fossil, distribution, and host-plant information will be created and made available to other researchers. Combining results from each component of the project will provide a comprehensive understanding of how bees have diversified and dispersed over time and how their partnership with plants has shaped their evolutionary trajectory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This so-called constant flux layer assumption is also widely used in land-surface flux measurements to quantify scalar fluxes to and from land surfaces. However, the reported failure of this assumption implies that scalar fluxes measured and modeled in the atmospheric surface layer are not equivalent to the fluxes across the surface-atmosphere interface, leading to uncertainty in measured and modeled fluxes in these applications. Despite the abundant studies on the roles of large turbulent eddies (i.e., coherent structures) in contributing to scalar fluxes, it is not well understood as to how large turbulent eddies contribute to changes in fluxes with height in the atmospheric surface layer. The objective of this project is to study what physical mechanisms regulate the attributes of large eddies across height that lead to varying contributions to fluxes with height, contributing to the failure of the constant flux layer assumption across a wide range of atmospheric conditions. <br/><br/>By leveraging the existing facilities and as guided by flux budget equations, a field experiment will be conducted over the large water body of Ross Barnett Reservoir in Ridgeland, Mississippi, with a flux tower equipped with five levels of eddy covariance systems and other instruments. The field experiment will provide a unique dataset that minimizes the influence of advective terms and enables more precise examination of the attributes of large turbulent eddies. A combined approach of several analysis methods, such as fast Fourier transform, wavelet transform, and ensemble empirical decomposition mode, will be used to characterize the attributes of large turbulent eddies and their variations with height across instability ranges. Quadrant analysis will be used to quantify asymmetric flux contributions from sweeps and ejections of large turbulent eddies, enabling an analysis of the underlying mechanisms that modulate changes in fluxes with height. Further, such analyses will allow the study of mechanisms that lead to different behaviors of height-varying fluxes for different scalars.

Specifically, the research focuses on understanding the process by which compounds known as organic structure directing agents (OSDAs) promote the growth of zeolite crystals that display specific physical and catalytic properties.  The investigators will integrate experiment and theory toward this goal, where cutting-edge simulation tools will be coupled with experimental measurements and advanced characterization techniques.  While the targeted zeolites are those used in diesel engine emissions control, the knowledge generated in the work will be broad-sweeping in scope. As such, the findings will have implications for renewable energy, improved technologies for advanced material production, and new approaches to generating intermediates/products in the pharmaceutical industry. The project incorporates educational and workforce training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, including cross-training of graduate students between the research groups.  Outreach activities will include interactive modules for K-12 outreach, a distance learning course related to emerging energy technologies, and new lab safety training modules for students.  All of those can be widely disseminated, adding to options for remote learning that will become more essential as the nation weathers the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.<br/><br/>The push for new energy sources has required an expansion in our understanding of fundamental chemistry. This is particularly true with respect to catalysis, with metal exchanged zeolites being actively utilized within industry. A significant roadblock to the further implementation of new zeolite catalysts is the general inability to control local structure such as active site spatial arrangement, a grand challenge problem in zeolite science. Recent work by one of the investigators? research groups indicates that it is potentially possible to control the aluminum arrangement within the framework of a small pore zeolite (known as SSZ-39) by simply varying the relative amount of the cis and trans isomer of the organic structure directing agent used in synthesis. The research objective of the project is thus to guide the rational synthesis of zeolites with controlled active site arrangement by understanding the nucleation and growth of SSZ-39 from a faujasite zeolite. The central hypothesis of the project is that the nucleation and growth of SSZ-39, in an interconversion process from faujasite, is controlled by the dissolution of the faujasite, with the SSZ-39 forming at the faujasite/aqueous interface via heterogeneous nucleation off the dissolving faujasite crystal. Research efforts will focus on ways to control the aluminum arrangement in a system where all synthesis parameters (save the isomer ratio) are held fixed. However, the understanding?and potential for efficient design?of active site control in zeolites requires both experimental and computational methodologies, as zeolite synthesis is complex and cannot be adequately described without advances in the marriage of experimental and computational research activities. The project thus addresses a critical need to develop comprehensive, multi-scale models and to advance the understanding and value of predictive tools within the STEM pipeline.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By integrating Smart Harvesting into the crop production feedback loop, we will enrich the system's repertoire and reduce uncertainties in crop production. Additionally, the research outcomes can benefit other labor-intensive orchard operations like flower thinning and pruning, which also face labor shortage issues.

The final product, a collaborative human-machine system for apple harvesting, will have a notable impact on rural agricultural communities. Its widespread adoption will contribute significantly to sustaining the competitiveness of the US tree fruit industry.<br/><br/>The project consists of three main areas of research. The first area focuses on creating a virtual reality orchard environment that is updated in real-time. This environment will use a network of sensors and a system called the Robotic Operation System that connects humans with machines. This will allow the control center to receive up-to-date 3D information about the orchard remotely. The second area aims to develop a collaborative framework where humans and machines work together effectively to harvest apples. This framework will utilize the virtual reality environment created in the first area. Human operators or machine learning techniques will be able to assist the robot system from a remote location. They can help the robot address challenges in apple picking, such as finding unidentifiable apples and determining the best way to retrieve them. The third area involves creating a constantly updating repertoire that incorporates information from human expertise and its own machine learning experience. It will record valuable information from human operators and its machine learning and use it to handle similar cases in the future autonomously.

Clean generation of hydrogen (H2) and its distribution and storage present challenges with conventional fossil fuel starting materials.  In contrast, this project utilizes formic acid (HCOOH) as a hydrogen carrier in a regenerative cycle based on water (H2O)  and carbon dioxide (CO2) as the starting materials.  Currently, the high cost of precious metal catalysts - needed to decompose the formic acid and generate the hydrogen - limits the commercial implementation of the technology.  The project investigates a novel concept by which less active, low-cost, earth-abundant catalytic materials such as copper (Cu) or nickel (Ni) can be made to perform like the precious metals with the aid of an electric field-assisted fuel reforming unit that will generate the hydrogen to power the fuel cell.  The investigators plan several educational and outreach activities to demonstrate the technology while also educating students at all levels on the ways in which electrochemistry and catalysis can facilitate the transition to a sustainable energy future.        <br/><br/>The potential use of CO2-based regenerative fuel cell technology holds interesting prospects for future energy systems based on non-fossil energy sources. Because the kinetics of the selective electrochemical reduction of CO2 to HCOOH are favorable, a regenerative fuel cell system utilizing on-demand H2 production from HCOOH decomposition is highly promising for practical purposes. However, the most efficient catalysts for HCOOH decomposition require a large amount of expensive noble metals such as platinum (Pt) and palladium (Pd). Earth-abundant pure Cu metal has shown both high activity and selectivity toward HCOOH decomposition at elevated temperatures, but no activity at ambient temperatures. This limitation can be circumvented by applying an electric field of optimum strength and orientation to the surface. The applied field will significantly increase the rate of HCOOH decomposition toward H2/CO2 production over Cu and Ni metals at ambient conditions, while preventing its undesired side reaction that leads to H2O/CO production. The project will address fundamental aspects of how this applied electric field influences both the HCOOH decomposition kinetics and catalytic properties of the metal surface through detailed kinetic studies utilizing field ion/electron microscopy in combination with atom-probe mass spectrometry, and by investigating the nature of the interactions (orientation and relative adsorption energy) between surface intermediates and an applied field using in-situ FTIR.  Based on this fundamental electric field-activity-selectivity relationship, a lab-scale HCOOH reforming system will be fabricated and evaluated.  HCOOH decomposition is an ideal model reaction to investigate the effect of an applied electric field on the catalytic properties of metals because of its significant permanent dipole moment and high polarizability, which makes its chemistry very sensitive to changes in surrounding electric fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A major issue is that rocks preserved from Earth?s earliest history are rare; there are few rocks from the first billion years of Earth?s history, and no intact rocks at all remaining from the first 500 million years.  Geologists must use a very fragmental record to determine when first continental crust formed, what was it composition, and how much of it existed.  This grant will support geologists to study the Earth?s oldest, unmodified fragment of a tectonic plate ? the Pilbara terrane of West Australia ? to address these issues.  The approach is to first determine the age of the rocks through the formation of minerals, such as zircons, that act a radioactive clocks (geochronology). Once the age is known, the chemistry of the rocks can determine if they were derived from an earlier crust or extracted directly from the Earth?s mantle (geochemistry).  The patterns and fabrics of these rocks (structural geology), when integrated with geochemistry and geochronology, will determine how and when the rocks were added to the crust to create these early continents.  The major outcome of this work will be a better understanding of the history of the Earth?s earliest crust and the processes that formed it.  The work includes student training, mentorship and support for a junior scientist (post-doctoral fellow), and international collaboration.  Additionally, work with a cognitive scientist will help students envision geological processes over large time scales.  The proposal will allow technique development of sophisticated geochemical and geochronologic analyses and their use in the WSU isotope laboratory by national and international visitors.<br/><br/>This proposal seeks to address the fundamental processes of crustal formation, modification, and stabilization by examining granitic complexes?the Mt Edgar and Corunna Downs?and associated surpracrustal rocks of the 3.5 ? 2.8 Ga East Pilbara terrane of West Australia, through an integrated geochronological, geochemical, and structural study.  The East Pilbara terrane is one of the best-preserved examples of Paleo- to Mesoarchean crust on Earth, displaying the classic dome-and-keel pattern in which granitic complexes (domes) are surrounded by steeply dipping volcanic and volcaniclastic supracrustal lithostratigraphy (keels).  Two central, interlinking questions guide our research: 1) What were the mechanisms and timing of emplacement of the granitic complexes; and 2) What were the mantle and crustal source regions for the rocks of the East Pilbara terrane.  To investigate these questions, our work will focus on: 1) The geochemistry and structure of the compositionally and deformationally heterogeneous granitic dome complexes; 2) The timing, metamorphic conditions, and structure in the deformed regions of the supracrustal lithostratigraphy (?greenstone keels?); and 3) The geochemistry of the metavolcanic rocks in the supracrustal lithostratigraphy and the grantic domes, in regions of minimal deformation, to address the mantle and crustal source regions.  This integrated geochemical and structural approach will provide information on first-order tectonic processes that resulted in the formation, modification, and stabilization of one of Earth?s earliest cratons and, therefore, provide important insights into the formation and preservation on some of the earliest continental crust on Earth.<br/><br/>This project is supported by both the Petrology & Geochemistry and Tectonics programs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

During this fundamental process, specific proteins randomly search for the proper DNA segment and then aggregate around it to form a molecular machinery that processes the genetic information. The accuracy and efficiency of DNA search is quite remarkable given the fact that the size of these proteins is about a thousand times smaller than the typical length of a gene. Currently, there is no rigorous theory explaining how proteins identify and bind to specific targets on DNA. Such a theory will not only lead to a quantitative understanding of fundamental functions of DNA, it will also help scientists investigate the cause of diseases, such as cancer and diabetes, and ultimately advance drug discovery. This project will introduce a novel hypothesis according to which the search process is partially facilitated and directed by the DNA molecule itself. New mathematical models will be developed to study specific mechanical changes of the double strand that have the potential to assist proteins in finding their way towards the desired DNA segments. Results will be validated by direct comparison with experimental data. This project will train both graduate and undergraduate students in the broad field of mathematical biology, with special effort to recruit students from underrepresented groups and minorities.<br/><br/>DNA allostery, i.e., the process by which proteins binding at one location of the double strand affect the properties of other proteins at a distant location, has been increasingly recognized as a key-factor in DNA functions. It has been traditionally believed that allosteric interactions are mediated through specific DNA deformations, such as twisting, bending, and stretching.  The proposed research will introduce and explain the physical mechanism of a new type of allostery through protein-induced DNA bubbles. Such a conformational change can spontaneously create protein filaments capable of regulating DNA packaging. To study this effect, this project will develop a novel mathematical framework that describes the stability of a polymer in the presence of time-dependent rigidity. The resulting protein-DNA structures are highly adaptive in external stimuli and can provide special biomechanical pathways that help proteins find specific gene segments (e.g., promoters) in a more efficient way. The efficiency of the search process will be studied as a mean-first-passage-time problem of a specially designed reaction diffusion model.<br/><br/>This award is co-funded with the Chemistry of Life Processes program in the Division of Chemistry and the Genetic Mechanisms and the Molecular Biophysics programs in the Molecular and Cellular Biosciences Division.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A dearth of data can negatively impact the predictive performance of machine learning algorithms. Because researchers recognize the surrogate role offered by synthetic data generators, they have been creating methods to generate increasingly realistic data proxies. Synthetic data can be automatically generated that balance the need to maximize multiple objectives. The goal of this project is to design a synthetic data generator that creates realistic individual and time series data to optimize cooperating or competing objectives in an adversarial manner. Building on this contribution, the algorithm will also be evaluated as a mechanism to increase model robustness, improve privacy preservation, and decrease model bias.<br/><br/>The outcomes of this project include the design of a novel multi-agent generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture, called HydraGAN, that balances multiple, possibly competing, data goals. While researchers have investigated constrained versions of multi-criteria GANs, this project will introduce a novel method that facilitates balancing any number of data criteria using a multi-agent GAN. A second outcome of the project will be a formal proof that the system will reach a Nash equilibrium during training. Furthermore, the HydraGAN algorithm will be enhanced to not only explore a traditional i.i.d. data generation format but also handle the more complex nature of time-series data, representing one of the first efforts to create multi-agent GANs for time series data. Multiple discriminator agents will be defined for the multi-agent system. Exploring beyond the traditional criteria of sample realism, cooperating or competing agents will address the underexplored constraints of privacy preservation, distribution realism, and meeting of diversity constraints. The project will demonstrate the utility of the created synthetic data for tackling machine learning challenges including data sparsity and representation bias.

As the world population is projected to reach 9.8 billion by 2050, more food will have to be produced than ever before.  Although considerable effort is directed at understanding how genes are regulated and transcribed into RNAs in the nucleus during grain development, very little is known about the cellular events that control the translation of these RNAs into protein in the cytoplasm. Previous efforts from this laboratory have demonstrated that grain RNAs are not immediately translated into protein when they exit the nucleus.  Instead, they form large particles, which are transported along several different pathways to the cortical region, a site located underneath the plasma membrane that surrounds the cell.  Studies supported by this grant will attempt to identify the mechanism by which these large RNA particles are formed and whether RNA species that code for proteins related by function are co-assembled into these particles.  Results from these studies may lead to new insights into the mechanisms that control the utilization and conversion of sugars into starch and of amino acids into protein reserves and, thereby, aid in efforts to increase grain productivity and yields.<br/><br/>The transport and localization of mRNAs to discrete intracellular sites in plant cells and their subsequent translation or processing are dependent on multiple assemblies of RNA binding proteins (RBPs).  These RBPs, which recognize specific cis-regulatory sequences on the RNA, play multiple post-transcriptional roles in the nucleus and cytoplasm.  As nearly all RBPs work in concert with other RBPs and accessory proteins, a deeper understanding of how these RBP complexes are formed and the nature of their RNA targets is essential before their function in post-transcriptional processes can be appreciated.  While many plant RBPs that mediate RNA localization and downstream processes have been identified, information on their organization into multi-RBP complexes is just beginning to emerge.  By contrast, nothing is known on the RNA binding sites and the nature of the mRNAs bound by plant RBP complexes.  While the technologies, seCLIP and RIPiT-Seq, are routinely used to identify the properties of RBPs from human cell lines, their utility in identifying the RNA targets of individual and interacting pairs of plant RBPs remains problematic.  As a proof of concept, this project will establish the experimental protocols for routine identification of RNA targets by four RBPs that co-assemble into two distinct multiprotein complexes.  Specifically, the project will define the RNA sequences bound by the four RBPs using seCLIP and the mRNA species bound by different combinations of RBPs using RIPiT-Seq.  Results from this study may provide evidence that mRNAs related by function, cytological location, or cellular fate are bound by the same RBPs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite its importance, many aspects of turbulence are still not well understood, in part due to the difficulty of performing experiments: for example, studying supersonic flow requires expensive wind tunnels, and neutron stars can only indirectly be measured.  While efforts are underway to study these systems through NSF funded programs like LIGO, recent advances in cold-atom technology provide a new platform to create turbulence in table-top experiments. For example, superfluid cold atoms have a very low speed of sound, enabling hypersonic flow, and are highly tunable, allowing them to directly model aspects of neutron stars. This project will establish a connection between quantum turbulence in these table-top experiments and important applications that complement ongoing efforts in nuclear physics, nuclear astrophysics, and classical turbulence.  The outcomes will not only progress science, but will identify unique quantum features that can be used to advance quantum technologies with future societal benefit similar to how previous advances in cold atom technology produced the precision clocks that enable GPS.<br/><br/>This project will explore the relationship between quantum and classical hydrodynamics, addressing questions about the microscopic origins of turbulence, and how the macroscopic hydrodynamics needed to model neutron stars etc. emerge from microscopic physics.  Specifically, it will explore how these macroscopic theories emerge after coarse-graining quantum systems, answering questions like: Are the emergent theories classical (i.e. do they flow to a Navier-Stokes-like fixed-point?) or do they retain unique quantum effects that can be exploited for new applications?  Methods will be developed for detecting and characterizing quantum turbulence in spite of destructive imaging, and will be validated in close collaboration with experimental groups, exploring new quantum phenomena along the way.  These validated methods will then be used to advance nuclear physics such as the origin of pulsar glitches. These investigations require high performance computing and sophisticated data analysis techniques, which will result in open source tools, broadly impacting a variety of related fields, and provide students with the skills needed for successful careers in science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Emerging infectious diseases and the global loss of biodiversity are two leading challenges for the life sciences in the 21st century. Declines of the iconic Tasmanian devil in Australia represent an example of these two threats acting together to endanger a species. Additionally, as such large predators decline, the role of other species shifts in the food chain, which can lead to loss of biodiversity via secondary declines and extinctions of other species. These community changes can then feed back on the predator themselves, resulting in changes in developmental timing and reproduction. Thus, it is critical to study how losses of top predators lead to changes in food webs, population densities, and evolution of species with which they interact. Through outreach to the general public, this study will increase understanding of how infectious diseases affect biological communities and influence biodiversity. It will also provide training opportunities for US graduate students and post-doctoral scholars in an international setting.<br/><br/>Tasmanian devils and their fatal transmissible cancer, devil facial tumor disease (DFTD), represents an ideal study system to elucidate the impacts of top predator losses on community dynamics. The east to west spread of DFTD provides a rare, natural experiment to test how temporal variation in extent of devil declines across Tasmania affects community dynamics. Devils are indeed community architects, the declines of which cause the direct effects of mesopredator release that then cascades through the food web to indirect secondary declines of native species. The research will bridge ecological and evolutionary theory to predict how co-evolutionary interactions of devils and DFTD will affect current and future devil population densities. These predictions will then be plugged into (structural equation) models that incorporate field studies of ecological interactions within the Tasmanian devil food web across the decline gradient. Feedbacks of these community-level changes on Tasmanian devil life history evolution will be evaluated with genomic study of the basis of a rapid developmental trajectory and precocial breeding in female devils. Evolutionary feedbacks on mesopredators and prey will be assessed using landscape genomics studies to test the influence of variation in devil density on gene flow and adaptive potential across multiple generations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Parallel programming with Message Passing Interface (MPI) is currently the most widely used and effective means of developing scalable parallel applications; however the productivity of application developers is lower than with programming models that offer a global shared view of data structures. In comparison, achieving high performance and scalability with global-address-space programming models is challenging. This project focuses on the development of a data-centric compiler/runtime framework, ""Parallel Algorithms by Blocks"" (PAbB), aimed at offering users the combined positive attributes of multiple parallel programming models without the disadvantages. The main novelty of this project is that it uses a combination of user insights, new compiler optimizations, and advanced runtime support to achieve both productivity and performance for an important class of computations that operate on matrices, tensors, and graphs. The main broader impact of the work is that it can significantly lower the barrier to entry for scientists from various domains who wish to develop new high-performance applications on large scale parallel systems, but presently find it too difficult with currently available parallel programming models. <br/><br/>This project brings together a team of investigators, with expertise across the software stack, to develop compiler tools and runtime systems for PAbB and demonstrate its use across a number of applications from computational science and data science. The PAbB model is intended to work in concert with MPI; that is, PAbB programs can execute in any standard MPI environment, interoperating with other native MPI code. The key idea behind the proposed approach is to offer the user a global-address view of the targeted data structures, requiring only (optionally in some cases) that they specify how data should be partitioned, but have the compiler/runtime handle the tedious aspects of the global-to-local re-indexing and inter-node data movement. In addition to the productivity benefit, a second significant benefit is in enabling system support for dynamic load balancing. The approach is being designed and demonstrated in the context of applications operating on dense and sparse matrices and tensors, and graphs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

NNA projects address convergence scientific challenges in the rapidly changing Arctic. This Arctic research is needed to inform the economy, security and resilience of the Nation, the larger region and the globe. NNA empowers new research partnerships from local to international scales, diversifies the next generation of Arctic researchers, enhances efforts in formal and informal education, and integrates the co-production of knowledge where appropriate. This award fulfills part of that aim by addressing interactions among social systems, natural environment, and built environment in the following NNA focus areas: Arctic Residents, Data and Observation, Forecasting, and Resilient Infrastructure.<br/><br/>In recent years, Alaska has witnessed high-intensity wildfires that often grow to tens or hundreds of thousand acres within days, both in remote, sparsely populated rural areas and close to population centers. Wildfires are projected to increase due to climate change and present new and emerging risks to Alaskan energy infrastructure and communities needing electricity for daily life and health services. Alaska is especially vulnerable to wildfires due to its isolated electricity grid, fire-prone boreal forests, and extreme fire behavior, as well as the critical dependence of its rural communities on electricity for health and year-round food supply. There is an urgent need to empower Arctic communities, electric utilities, emergency responders, and health organizations to collaboratively share resources and exchange information for improved situational awareness and resilience against wildfires. The FIREWALL research project will advance the knowledge on (1) how elements of the natural environment, energy infrastructure, and social systems interact with one another before, during, and following wildfires, and (2) how to enable a collaborative framework for decision-making and communication among multi-sectoral stakeholders to reduce wildfire risks faced by communities and electric utilities.<br/><br/>The FIREWALL project will develop a risk-informed decision-making platform that integrates (1) formation, short-term prediction, and spatiotemporal propagation analysis of wildfires on Alaskan lands, (2) Alaska?s electricity network planning, preparedness, response, and mitigation facing wildfires, and (3) community health and social vulnerability metrics. The project will establish a shared understanding of the problem by engaging in focus groups, listening sessions, and surveys with community partners. The decision-making platform will be evaluated in a range of short-term and long-term use cases for the electric utilities, forestry managers, and emergency responders under different fire regimes, and will be tested in a number of wildfire-prone geographical zones in Alaska. The project outcomes will bridge the gap between social and environmental challenges with community-in-the-loop engineering solutions for wildfire resilience, and provide Arctic residents with numerous educational opportunities. The education activities include outreach to K-12 teachers and students, and training the multi-sectoral stakeholders using the FIREWALL platform products to facilitate a smooth transition for deployment in practice. The project will have the potential to form holistic integrated roadmaps that can enhance public safety and resilience of the mission-critical lifeline infrastructure in Alaska and beyond when facing future wildfire disasters.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This Pilot and Feasibility project builds on the success of US Cooperative Extension Service programs that empower volunteers to conduct outreach in their own communities. It focuses on climate change, and seeks to co-design an informal STEM climate science curriculum, called Climate Stewards, in collaboration with community members from groups often underrepresented in STEM, including indigenous and Latinx communities, as well as rural women. The project is designed to strengthen community awareness as well as prioritize community voices in climate change conversations. The knowledge and skills obtained by Climate Stewards and their communities will allow for more involvement in decisions related to climate adaptation and mitigation in their communities and beyond. After establishing a proof of concept, the project seeks to expand this work to more rural and urban communities, other communities of color, and additional socioeconomically disadvantaged communities. <br/><br/>Grounded in the theory of diffusion of innovation as a means for volunteers to communicate information to members of a social system, this project seeks co-create a retooled Climate Stewards curriculum using inclusive and adaptive strategies. Community collaboration and involvement through new and existing partnerships, focus groups, and meetings will determine what each community needs. During the program design phase, community members can share their concerns regarding climate change as well as the unique characteristics and cultural perspectives that should be addressed. The collaboration between extension and education leverage resources that are important for developing a robust implementation and evaluation process. This project is expected to have a significant influence on local and national programs that are looking to incorporate climate change topics into their programming and/or broaden their reach to underrepresented communities. The hypotheses tested in this project describe how inclusion-based approaches may influence competencies in STEM topics and their impact on communities, specifically willingness to take action. Hypothesis 1: STEM competencies in climate issues increase with interactive and peer learning  approaches. Hypothesis 2: Community participation in the co-creation of knowledge about climate change, by integrating their values and objectives into the climate change education program, increases people's motivation to become engaged in climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies.<br/><br/>This Pilot and Feasibility project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to (a) advance new approaches to and evidence-based understanding of the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments; (b) provide multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences; (c) advance innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments; and (d) engage the public of all ages in learning STEM in informal environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project considers both observable and unobservable service systems depending on what information is available to customers. The project will provide tools for the service provider to decide what information to provide to potential customers and to assess the benefits of dynamic pricing relative to simpler static pricing. The project will involve the development of exact and approximate algorithms for determining optimal policies that practitioners can use to solve a broad class of real-world problems. The project will use a case study on port terminal operations that will be used to validate the methods and which terminal operators can use to build their own models and algorithms to obtain optimal pricing strategies.

We know little about the origins and initial development of these skills during the first two years of life. It is during infancy, however, that behavioral and neurophysiological underpinnings of emotion reactivity, the precursor of regulation, are manifested. Moreover, sex differences in these foundational mechanisms have not been examined, despite considerable evidence of more advanced early regulation for girls. This research provides an intensive behavioral and brain activity examination of emotion reactivity, making connections with emerging self-regulation. Our study is the first to examine: (1) development of brain activity linked with fear/approach and related information processing biases across infancy, relying on emotion-eliciting tasks; (2) sex differences in brain activity changes across infancy, correspondence between behavioral and brain activity change patterns, and the extent to which these predict self-regulation around the 2nd birthday. Identified connections between reactivity and regulation will inform existing developmental theories and results will be disseminated to parents and early childhood educators, maximizing support for emerging child self-regulation.<br/><br/>Starting in infancy, regulation is supported by attentional capacity and becomes essential to functioning across most areas of life. Despite this importance, the origins of self-regulation are still poorly understood, especially with respect to the emotional underpinnings. Emotional reactivity ?comes online? first, creating a foundation for subsequent development of regulatory capacity. Thus, growth in the principal domains of reactivity (fear and approach) in infancy, and links between these developmental changes and emerging self-regulation, require further study. We will answer lingering questions regarding how fearfulness and approach orientation on the behavioral and brain activity level are interrelated, and the extent to which these characteristics set the stage for self-regulation. We will leverage electroencephalography (EEG) recordings and multiple evaluations across the first two years of life to discern how changes in fear and approach contribute to the development of attention-based self-regulation, and how these processes may differ for boys and girls. As a result, parents and educators can be instructed regarding developmental periods during which effective negotiation of extreme changes in child approach or avoidance are particularly important from the standpoint of promoting regulation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Due to their oscillatory motion waves move sediments back and forth and the net transport, averaging over many waves and conditions, is responsible for accretion or erosion of beaches. Shoreward sediment transport is critical to understanding how beaches rebuild in response to rising sea levels, storms, and the construction of engineered coastal structures. Improved understanding of shoreward transport, the focus of this study, will enable better model parameterizations to predict this response and forecast the potential recovery of the coastline following a storm. The fundamental processes underlying wave-driven shoreward transport are among the least understood and most elusive processes in nearshore oceanography. Numerous competing theoretical mechanisms are likely to contribute, but there is a critical lack of validation data to determine their relative importance.  The proposed work is an interdisciplinary collaboration that brings together oceanography, fluid dynamics, and engineering to address the scientific fundamentals of a problem with significant societal implications. Field measurements of turbulence and sediment will be carried out on a natural beach. The experimental data will be combined with advance numerical modelling techniques that will allow identification of the most important wave-driven shoreward mechanisms on a natural beach. Apart for the scientific and engineering values of the study, the project will provide contribute to the training PhD students and it will expose undergraduate students into field research. Public outreach will be conducted through the development of short documentary-style video.<br/><br/>Modeling shoreward transport requires representation of multiple transport processes that act across a broad range of scales, from small-scale turbulence, sediment mobilization, and fluid-sediment feedbacks, to wavelength-scale nonlinear wave processes. In the past, direct investigation of such processes has only been possible in laboratory studies, which have uncertain applicability to real nearshore environments due to scaling effects and simplified dynamics. Full-scale experiments, on the other hand, represent realistic dynamics but often sacrifice resolution, e.g. by only measuring average transport over many wave periods, leaving uncertainty as to what processes are contributing to transport. The key components of this study are the utilization of a purpose-built, broadband pulse-coherent acoustic Doppler profiler (MFDop), and detailed process models, which together resolve the full suite of transport mechanisms that have been hypothesized to occur on natural beaches. The MFDop system is a profiler, capable of measuring sediment concentration and velocity fluctuations at high frequency (50 Hz) and with a vertical resolution of 4 mm capable of resolving the wave boundary layer that extends a few cm above the seabed. The MFDop system and supporting instrumentation will be deployed on a natural beach in Oregon to measure the vertical structure of boundary layer velocities and sediment suspension as a function of the free-stream velocity and pressure gradient. The data collected will guide modeling experiments simulating flow and sediment variability at wavelength and cm-scales (Reynolds-averaged 1-D vertical simulations) and at sub-cm to sub-mm scales capable to resolve boundary layer eddies and sediment particles (Large eddy simulation (LES) modelling). A nested approach will be developed aiming at adding wavelength-effects into LES modelling while avoiding computational limitation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The sugars produced form the general energy basis for plant and animal life. Photosynthesis mostly takes place in leaves (referred to as sources), which are not the organs where most of the sugars are consumed. Instead, sugars are transported to developing sink organs such as roots, fruits, grains, and tubers that we utilize for our nutrition and for animal feeding. Sugar translocation from sources to sinks takes place in a vascular tissue called phloem. The partitioning process in the phloem is surprisingly poorly understood, given its central role in food and feed production. Today it remains unclear what controls the allocation of sugars in the phloem. Are sufficient sugars produced during photosynthesis, while the downstream transport process is the limiting factor?  Or do plant sinks have sufficient capacity while photosynthesis is insufficient to meet the sink storage capacity? This project will investigate if sources or sinks are limiting plant productivity, and what strategies plants have evolved to fill their sink tissues. To tackle these fundamental questions and to investigate sugar allocation on the cellular level, we will employ recently developed tools for in situ observation of the phloem, microscopy protocols for 3D reconstruction of tissues at high resolution, and a novel machine learning algorithm software to quantify structural changes. Together, our diverse approaches will provide a solid basis for the evaluation of the most promising strategies for future crop improvement. Additionally, this project also engages diverse student groups and teachers worldwide through webpages on cell biology and software tools generated for educational purposes.<br/><br/>A core question in plant productivity is whether plants are sink- or source-limited. This question is directly linked to phloem physiology because the phloem distributes photoassimilates to sinks. The phloem forms a network of tubes of low hydraulic resistance throughout the plant. The physical driving forces for long-distance translocation are generated by assimilate loading and unloading in distant organs. Detachment from either sinks or sources causes an instant cessation of transport function and structural artifacts. Meaningful experiments therefore have to be performed in situ. This is technically demanding and the main reason why fundamental questions have remained unanswered. Here we address a basic problem with our understanding of sink-source relations. Based on the physics of the current textbook hypothesis of phloem unloading and transport ? the High-Pressure Manifold Model ? plants generally should be sink-limited, which would imply that increased crop photosynthetic capacities would be of limited value. This problem relates to the central question if sieve tube conductivity is actively controlled in plants. New methods for in situ observation, electron microscopy protocols, and machine learning algorithms have been developed to precisely and quantitatively characterize the structure of phloem components. We will utilize plants with controlled source-to-sink distances to provoke morphological and functional responses in the phloem. If there is an active adjustment of tube conductivity, the identification of the controlling factors would create a new research field and provide potential targets for crop improvement. If there is no such adjustment, the High-Pressure Manifold Model will be rejected, setting the stage for the search for alternative sink filling models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By providing information from two populations on 1) the frequency and costliness of signals of need across development and 2) the extent to which those signals receive positive or negative responses from caregivers, this project provides insight into why children differ in their signaling behavior and why parents might respond positively or negatively to indications of child need.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These events are a challenge to monitor due to hazardous conditions, uncertainty in eruption timing, and remote eruption locations.  Hazard mitigation requires (1) remote detection of eruption conditions and (2) an understanding of the ash distribution above the volcano, which can then disperse across the upper atmosphere.  This study will address both critical issues by exploring the link between turbulence, ash particle dynamics, and electrification.  Following an eruption, volcanic ash particles encounter turbulence, which can promote particle interaction, electric charging, and clustering.  Electrified plumes can trigger volcanic lightning, a spectacular phenomenon that may be used to study hazardous eruptions in near real-time.  These discharges generate broadband radiation (e.g. radio waves) that can carry information about the interior of the flow far beyond the immediate vicinity of the volcano.  Electrical forces can also cause clustered particles to combine, accelerating their fall back to the ground.  In addition, particle aggregation is strongly influenced by moisture in the plume and the atmosphere.  These processes are critical to the hazards of volcanic ash, yet they are challenging to model.  The effects of turbulence, aggregation, and electrification are closely linked, but their interactions have never been experimentally quantified.  Hence, there is a need for improved measurements of these effects, which can be used to create accurate models of volcanic ash transport. This project will enhance the education of three graduate students through participation in these experiments and through scientific communication training through which they will develop hands-on demonstrations for public outreach. <br/><br/>This project aims to develop improved predictions of volcanic plume behavior through high-accuracy experiments and advanced computational models.

While beneficial microbes that live on and inside of plants play key roles in plant health, little is known about how a plants? ability to benefit from these cooperative microbes changes during domestication. Plant-microbe cooperation is not stable. In fact, plants have repeatedly abandoned cooperation with microbes over evolutionary time, and growing evidence shows that some crops evolve to depend less on microbes over the course of domestication. This reveals a gap in our understanding of the evolution of cooperation: what evolutionary processes result in abandoning cooperation? And why does cooperation with microbes decline for some plant species, but not others? To investigate how these symbiotic relationships differ between modern crops and their wild relatives, this project will use seed collections and genomic resources for legume crops ranging from soybeans to peas. The utility of legumes in agriculture lies in their unique symbiosis with rhizobial bacteria, which convert atmospheric nitrogen into chemical forms usable to plants, essentially fertilizing them. At least forty-one legume species have been domesticated. Researchers will compare domesticated legumes? ability to benefit from rhizobia to that of their wild relatives by using modern genetic and analytical approaches. These techniques will provide insight into how natural selection has changed patterns of cooperation between legumes and rhizobia during domestication. Legumes account for a quarter of global crop production and a third of human dietary protein. Understanding how and why rhizobial symbiosis has evolved during domestication will provide a critical road map for ways in which we could improve crop yield in order to increase our ability to feed our growing human population. Crop domestication is also a tangible example of evolution in action--domesticated species have provided an intuitive model for evolutionary biology since Darwin?s original arguments. Project research will engage undergraduates with evolutionary problems in familiar food crops. To increase the inclusion of underrepresented minority and community college transfer students in science, the researchers will develop a new Course-based Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE) module on symbiosis and crop domestication and a new Science Scholars Program to recruit and retain diverse undergraduates in scientific research.<br/><br/>A paradigm shift in the field of mutualism evolution is a newfound appreciation for the frequency with which host organisms, such as plants, have abandoned mutualisms with symbiotic microbiota. Yet, little is known about the micro-evolutionary processes that lead to declines in host symbiosis traits. This project will use germplasm and genomic resources that exist for legume crops as a powerful system with which to investigate declines in plant symbiosis traits over replicated evolutionary lineages from wild plants to modern elite cultivars. By integrating approaches from phylogenetics, molecular genetics, quantitative genetics, and genomics, this project will contribute fundamental knowledge about the role of trade-offs, natural selection, and genetic costs in shaping micro-evolutionary dynamics in symbiotic mutualism. To elucidate the traits, forms of selection, and loci that underlie changes in legume-rhizobium symbiosis across thousands of years of evolution in agriculture, researchers will: 1) quantify how the nitrogen-fixing symbiosis with rhizobia differs between leguminous crops and their wild relatives, 2) test whether legume symbiosis traits have negative genetic correlations with legume traits favored under artificial selection, 3) test whether fertilization relaxes selection on legume symbiosis traits or selects for reduced symbiosis, and 4) infer whether genetic costs of domestication are predicted to degrade symbiosis traits in crops. This work will pave the way towards integrating an understanding of the evolutionary forces and constraints that underlie dynamics between hosts and microbial symbionts into the mainstream of evolutionary biology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While higher CO2 levels could potentially have beneficial effects for trees, a drier atmosphere may outweigh those positive impacts and instead lead to increased forest mortality. Forest mortality has major consequences for clean air, clean water, and biodiversity. In order to address the uncertainty of the net effect of rising CO2 and a drier atmosphere on forests, this research will combine field experiments that directly expose trees to different CO2 and atmospheric dryness levels, from which plant physiological measurements will be taken. These measurements will be combined with a global tree transpiration dataset to parameterize and validate a model that will improve the ability to predict the effects of these impacts on forests. In addition, this project will recruit and train scientists from underrepresented groups in science to promote a diverse and globally competitive workforce and support outreach activities that engage K-12 students in hands-on science.<br/><br/>The net impact of rising CO2 levels and rising atmospheric aridity, measured as vapor pressure deficit (VPD), on forests is one of the largest uncertainties in model projections of the terrestrial carbon sink and the water cycle. Current evidence suggests that the negative impacts of VPD will outweigh the positive impacts of increased CO2, but direct tests, physiological measurements, and a multi-scale understanding of mechanisms and consequences are lacking. To address this, this research will use a three-pronged approach by combining 1) the first field experiment that directly manipulates CO2 and VPD, 2) a global-scale sapflux dataset enabling examination of species- and ecosystem-specific variation in CO2 versus VPD impacts, and 3) a process-based model that will be parameterized and validated using datasets from both (1) and (2).

Research suggests that students exhibit greater motivation and resilience to challenges when they believe that their intellectual abilities can improve. These students ultimately have better academic outcomes than those who believe their intellectual abilities are fixed. This project will design interventions to foster positive student beliefs. The interventions will be customized to the cultural and institutional context in which they will be implemented. This project will involve developing, implementing, and assessing the short-term and long-term psychological and academic outcomes of interventions to help undergraduate introductory biology students adopt more positive beliefs about their abilities. The interventions? effectiveness will be assessed using a new, high-quality measure of students? beliefs. This project will answer pressing research questions related to implementing interventions and the psychological theories underlying this work. The significance of this project will include advancing the understanding of psychological theory and improving educational outcomes for all students. Importantly, this project has potential to improve equity in academic outcomes by being especially beneficial for students who encounter additional barriers in higher education. These students include those who are first-generation college students and those from groups traditionally underrepresented in STEM, among other marginalized groups. <br/><br/>This project will address three of the most pressing research questions to advance the understanding of how mindset interventions could be used to improve student success and equity in science. The project?s research questions include: (1) How do mindset interventions at two different levels, student and instructor, affect student outcomes independently and in concert? (2) What are the mechanisms through which mindset interventions at both the student- and instructor-level influence students? experiences in the classroom, academic engagement, and academic outcomes in the short and long term? And (3) How do students? racial/ethnic identity and generation in college moderate any identified effects? These questions will be addressed by carrying out large-scale, fully-crossed, randomly-assigned field experiments in introductory biology courses at four sites (N>10,000 students). Growth mindset interventions have shown great potential to address large-scale educational inequities in logistically simple, cost-effective ways. This project will capitalize on this potential by investigating how mindset messages from instructors enhance the effectiveness of interventions at the undergraduate level. This work will not only have broad impacts by addressing social inequities to broaden participation in STEM, but will also have intellectual merit by generating a more nuanced understanding of how contextual messages moderate intervention effectiveness.

Multiple types of genome data from closely related bear species will be used to identify regions of the polar bear genome that underlie specific physiological adaptations. This information will improve understanding of current and future impacts of climate change on these animals. To broaden participation and diversity in Arctic science, the fellow will conduct public outreach, organize workshops, and mentor students from underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>While brown and black bears undergo annual hibernation in response to seasonal prey scarcity, the ability to hibernate has been greatly reduced, and nearly lost altogether, in the adaptation of polar bears to the Arctic.

Through the integration of functional and population genomics datasets, this project will characterize the landscape of protein coding and regulatory evolution in three bear lineages and test the hypothesis that regulatory evolution facilitated the rapid adaptation of the polar bear lineage to Arctic environments. This work will advance understanding of the mechanisms and complexity of polar bear adaptations, the processes by which polar bears adapted to Arctic environments, and the vulnerability of this apex predator to climate change.

These systems combine favorable properties of the polymers, e.g. light weight, mechanical toughness and flexibility, and the fillers with their high strength, electrical and thermal conductivity, in a tunable fashion. Such combinations lead to unique overall properties that cannot be achieved by conventional materials. These materials are utilized in many emerging technologies such as energy storage, biochemical sensing, flexible electronics and artificial tissue engineering important to the national prosperity and competitiveness. A primary challenge in realizing PNs involves the development of new manufacturing methods to process these materials with high resolution and precise control over filler morphology within the final product that dictates the final part properties. Emerging additive manufacturing methods, particularly direct-ink-writing (DIW), where the PN ""inks"" are dispensed through nozzles and deposited with high spatial control, has been shown to achieve high resolution manufacturing of PN parts with controllable filler morphologies. This award supports the fundamental research that will provide the knowledge needed for additively manufacturing PN parts having ""as-designed"" properties with high customizability, precision and accuracy. This capability will enable many emerging technologies critical to societal health, national security and the energy sector such as customizable biochemical sensors, high performance energy storage devices and lightweight high-strength military equipment manufacturing. The educational effort will provide a model for integration of additive manufacturing into the mechanical engineering curriculum which in turn will equip the next generation manufacturing workforce with a much needed skill-set. The outreach activities that will be realized in this project will increase the public awareness and readiness for the additive manufacturing and flexible electronics concepts.<br/><br/>Despite the promising potential of additive manufacturing in processing of PNs, there exists a knowledge gap in regard to relationships between raw material properties-process parameters-final part properties.

To this end, PN inks will be modeled through a new viscoelastic material model that incorporates the effect of temporally and spatially varying filler morphology on the bulk ink rheology. This model will be used in experimentally validated computational fluid dynamics simulations that will output critical stress and strain parameters in the deposited filaments during the printing process. Finally, studies will be conducted to understand how these model outputs translate to specific morphologies of nanoparticles as well as the electrical and mechanical properties of the manufactured parts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

New technologies enhancing environmental sustainability, defense capability, and consumer products have sharply increased the demand for the REE. However, the supply of REE in the U.S. relies mostly on their import from foreign sources. Furthermore, many of the domestic deposits suffer from high concentrations of thorium (Th) and uranium (U) that contaminate the environment during mining. To deal with this issue, it is necessary to discover the conditions needed for economic concentrations of the REE to form in nature in the absence of Th or U; this requires understanding how Th and U mix with the REE in minerals and how such mixing can be avoided. This project will explore how Th and U mix with the REE in minerals through a combination of experiments and geological modeling. These results will make it possible to predict the natural environments in which Th- and U-poor REE minerals form and thereby provide geologists with the information they need to develop strategies to explore for and locate deposits of REE that can be economically and safely mined. This project also aims to educate high school, undergraduate, and graduate students in geochemistry, and prepare them for careers as scientists. The integrated education plan is committed to holding summer geochemistry schools for high school students, promoting geochemical education to student through visits to national laboratories and virtual lectures, and engaging students in the experimental and modeling methods that are used in the research project.<br/><br/>The objective of this research proposal is to generate new knowledge enabling identification of the conditions under which Th and U-depleted REE phosphate ores can form. One of the major impediments to the recovery of REE from ores in the U.S. is the radioactivity generated during their processing and refining due to the presence of high concentrations of Th and U in the main REE ore minerals, monazite and xenotime. Thus, there is a strong need to find Th, U-depleted REE ores, which, in turn, depends on developing a better understanding of their formation conditions (e.g., temperature, pressure, oxygen fugacity, pH, etc.), particularly those for which the incorporation of Th and U into phosphate structures is minimal. Whereas the properties of the aqueous species of the REE, U, and Th are now reasonably well-known for the hydrothermal conditions of REE ore formation, there is almost no information on phosphate-based REE/U/Th solid solutions. A major challenge is to correctly account for thermodynamic non-ideality due to the mixing of Th and U with the REE, which is often incorrectly assumed to be ideal and thus can lead to inaccurate or false predictions. This project will establish accurate thermodynamic models describing the incorporation of Th and U in REE phosphates that are critically needed by geochemical modelers to predict the mobilization, fractionation, and deposition of REE/U/Th in hydrothermal systems. The knowledge obtained will enable the development of new exploration techniques permitting the identification and localization of Th- and U-depleted REE ores. The project also offers unique opportunities for students to receive the interdisciplinary education and training needed to become geochemists with broad mindsets and skillsets. This includes summer geochemistry schools for high school students and teachers to develop their interest in the geochemistry of the REE and other critical metals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As a well-characterized system with quantifiable outcomes (e.g. water levels, volumes, flows, fates) and a well-established but diverse and evolving regulatory environment, dam and reservoir management offers an opportunity to test fundamental hypotheses about tradeoffs between rules-based and discretion-based management approaches to gain deeper understanding of adaptive management of reservoirs specifically, and of the nature of socio-environmental integration generally.

Scavengers and microorganisms play a critical role in returning carcass-derived nutrients to the soil where they get recycled and used for plant uptake and growth. The impact of carrion inputs on nutrient cycling, food web dynamics, and ecosystem carbon balance remains a mystery. With global declines of many species including scavengers, it is essential to quantify how the quantity and quality of carrion-derived nutrients shapes plant community structure and ecosystem dynamics. Tasmanian devils are an ideal and charismatic species with which to study the effects of scavenging on ecosystem processes. They are one of a few carnivores worldwide that consume bones. By accelerating the cycling of key plant growth-limiting nutrients that would otherwise remain locked in bone material for years, Tasmanian devils provide a critical ecosystem function. In recent years, the emergence of a highly transmissible cancer ? devil facial tumor disease, or DFTD ? has dramatically reduced devil population sizes in eastern Tasmania and has spread throughout the island, threatening this iconic species with extinction. Researchers will use this tragic situation to test whether devil-scavenging impacts can be detected on an ecosystem scale and how devil population declines result in a shift in the role of other scavenger species. This project will provide training opportunities for US graduate students and post-doctoral scholars in an international setting. Through education and outreach activities, researchers will highlight the linkages that exist between scavengers, biodiversity, and ecosystem resiliency. <br/><br/>Few studies have directly investigated the effects of non-plant inputs on energy transfer within food web networks. As a result, there is a considerable knowledge gap in understanding how carrion and scavenger guilds govern biogeochemical cycling at an ecosystem scale. In Tasmania, the east to west spread of DFTD, a lethal, transmissible cancer, threatens devils with extinction and has created a population density gradient across the island (from 0% to 100% of carrying capacity). The resulting 'natural experiment' offers a rare opportunity to study how apex scavenger declines alter energy transfer within food webs and nutrient flows through carrion, soils, and plants. High-frequency monitoring and sampling stations will be established at five study sites that span the DFTD gradient and capture four experimental treatments: (1) full scavenger access (staked prey carcass); (2) devil exclusion (fenced prey carcass allowing access to all scavengers but devils); (3) reconstructed devil latrines to capture nutrient pulses from localized scat; (4) and soil-only controls to monitor background C and nutrient availability. Devil and mesopredator densities at carcasses will be estimated using camera arrays; invertebrate densities will be assessed using appropriate insect traps. Stable isotope tracing will be used to track how carcass-derived nutrients influence microbial community diversity and soil carbon formation. Plant productivity (NPP), leaf quality, seedling recruitment, and fine root biomass will be estimated at each site and across the continental DFTD gradient. Using temporal and spatial variation in the extent and timing of devil population declines, a series of scaled experiments will be used to: (1) determine how variation in scavenger densities affects local soil biogeochemistry; (2) investigate how carrion and scavenging networks induce shifts in the metabolic efficiency of microbial communities and decomposition rates of new plant litter inputs; (3) test the scale at which scavenging by devils is detectable; and (4) integrate findings from field and laboratory experiments to predict how biodiversity loss will affect ecosystem function over the next 50 years. The project will support a team led by an early-career female scientist, involve international collaboration and provide training at the graduate student and postdoctoral levels.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This sea ice habitat is critical for providing polar bears a way to access seals, their primary prey. Polar bears hunt seals where they come up to breathe at holes in the ice and when they haul out onto the ice to have their pups.  The blubber of seals is the primary energy source for polar bears throughout the Arctic. A changing Arctic climate has already reduced the amount of sea ice that bears can use to access seals, and continued warming of several degrees over the next 100 years is expected to further decrease sea ice during the summer and early fall in many parts of the Arctic.  With less ice, polar bears across much of the Arctic are spending more time on land where they cannot access seals. Although polar bears have been observed feeding on nesting geese and seabirds, berries, and vegetation, these foods are more disbursed and less-energy rich than the typical prey of polar bears.  Thus, land-based foods may not occur in sufficient quality, quantity, or distribution to ensure the current widespread distribution of polar bears. This study seeks to better understand bear behavior on land and the degree to which land-based foods meet the energetic needs of polar bears.  The question of whether bears lose or maintain their body mass for extended periods on land is critical to determining potential effects of sea ice loss on birth and death rates ? information that most Arctic nations need to manage their resident polar bears.  Because polar bears occur at the top of the Arctic food chain, they are also a key indicator species for changes in the Arctic as well as an iconic symbol of the effects of a changing climate. Our results will help identify actions to further protect this species and the communities whose cultures and safety are closely linked to the behavior of this Arctic predator.<br/><br/>The goals of this study are to determine the behavior and energetic balances of polar bears while summering on land.  We are proposing to 1) quantify the degree to which foods consumed while on land meet the energetic needs of polar bears and 2) thereby provide the information necessary to understand the implications of increasing warming, sea ice loss, and land use on polar bear well-being and population dynamics across the Arctic. We will do this by measuring energy expenditure, weight change, fat and protein composition of the weight change, activity and movement rates, and feeding behavior of males and females, young and old while they are on land. We will estimate the amount of energy coming from food as the difference between the energy expenditure measured with doubly labeled isotopic water and the energy released when body fat and protein are mobilized. If these values are equal, no useful energy is coming from food.  If the energy expenditure measured with doubly labeled water is higher than that available from mobilized protein and fat, then that difference is the amount of energy coming from ingested food. These measurements can only be done with the most advanced techniques available for human and animal research. These techniques include 1) GPS collars with built in video cameras that will allow us to accurately track bear movements and directly observe what they are doing and eating and 2) an isotopic water dilution technique that allows measurement of the number of calories they burn and how much fat and protein they gain or lose between two captures which will be about 21 days apart. These techniques will allow us to determine the implications of polar bears increasingly using land as their sea ice habitat continues to decline.  Thus, this study will provide information for understanding the future of polar bear populations, a significant part of Arctic food web, in a warming Arctic.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

ESC fosters such innovations by implementing on high-performance computers novel computational methods that numerically solve mathematical models of physical systems.<br/><br/>As ESC advances research worldwide, this project will educate globally minded students for international research leadership in Engineering and Scientific Computing. Indeed, ESC professionals with both scientific computing and global engagement skills are in high demand by multinational corporations, government research laboratories, and academia. This demand prompts a need to increase the number of students in computing research, beginning with undergraduate students, as they progress in the educational pipeline towards employment or graduate school. This IRES program will involve twenty-one diverse U.S. students over three years. Diversity will be achieved by recruiting students from different genders and heritages including, but not limited to, American, African, Asian, Hispanic, and Native American heritages. Each year, there will be a cohort of seven U.S. students who will complete a fifteen-week long research experience in Sweden. In each same year, this cohort will be expanded with seven Swedish students, separately supported by Sweden. Students in the expanded cohort will interact with one another to establish a future international professional network for all participants. Sweden is a desirable overseas destination for this program, also in view of the partnerships among U.S. and Swedish corporations that use ESC. These corporations include Sweden?s Saab as well as Boeing, which are collaborating with each other in the fulfillment of a major nine-year U.S. Air Force contract and will also support this program through computing projects and internships. The Swedish host for this program is Linköping University (LiU). This is an ideal international partner as it develops and applies mathematically robust algorithms, serves as the main partner of its region?s Visualization Center, and manages Sweden?s National Supercomputer Center. This center houses the largest high-performance computer in Sweden, which features 1.5 petabytes of data storage, 480 GPU?s, and a processing speed of 300 petaflops. The IRES scholars will thus have access to leadership-class facilities and conduct their research in the welcoming international Computational Mathematics research environment within LiU?s Division of Applied Mathematics. By developing globally engaged students who have practiced scientific computing research overseas, this IRES program will also widen students? professional opportunities as well as global horizons. By living in a different country and culture, the participants will also sharpen their interaction, resilience, and resourcefulness skills in navigating distinct cultures, expectations, and processes. These transferrable skills are valued by employers and multinational corporations highly. <br/><br/>The U.S. students will contribute to advance engineering and scientific computing by completing research projects on the development of efficient, stable, and high-order accurate algorithms for investigating  realistic physical processes. These algorithms will discretely approximate and numerically solve systems of linear and non-linear time-dependent partial differential equations, emphasizing rapid convergence and scalability on high-performance computer architectures. The scholars will explore the development of innovative discrete differentiation operators on arbitrary point sets via machine learning, neural networks, and orthogonal functions, including Chebyshev polynomials, to increase spatial accuracy. The resulting stiff ordinary differential equations will be integrated through low-diffusion, e.g. symplectic, implicit time stepping processes. The resulting non-linear algebraic equations will then be solved via Newton iteration, leading to the solution of sequences of linear systems. These will be solved  through combinations of direct and iterative Krylov-type flexibly preconditioned numerical linear algebra solvers. An initial field for the iterative solution of these linear systems on dense grids will be generated via interpolation of a direct Gaussian-elimination solution within a coarse grid. The scholars will practice the skills to apply mathematical frameworks and also appreciate the approximations involved in computational models, understand the range of validity of computational results, and analyze these results critically. These are crucially needed skills. Efficient and scalable computational algorithms are important worldwide to advance fields of knowledge that critically rely on scientific computing and thereby advance technological development as well as designs cost effectively. This is because these designs increasingly rely on computational simulations, which usher in the era of e-design to lower development costs, increase first-time quality of prototypes, and decrease time to bring complex systems, such as aircraft, to markets.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The need for resilience is particularly critical for the aging mid- and low-voltage power distribution systems, responsible for an estimated 90% of the outages. This CAREER project proposes a transformative approach to manage disruptions and improve the operational resilience of the distribution systems by leveraging upon the recent smart grid advances. The proposed innovations add the required flexibility for island formation and bottom-up restoration using distributed energy resources (DERs) and enhanced distribution automation capabilities, thus, allowing for a faster recovery of critical services during a natural disaster. A successful completion of this project will: 1) improve public safety and reduce the cost of natural disasters to US economy using automated and distributed solutions for resilience, 2) help develop new standards to tap into the potential for growing levels of DER penetrations for grid resilience, and 3) encourage DER integration and help reduce US carbon footprint by setting new value propositions for DER technology. The models and results of this effort can be potentially extended to other critical infrastructures. An equally important component of this project focuses on addressing the critical need for a skilled, interdisciplinary, and inclusive workforce to support the future power distribution grid with the help of a well-integrated education plan. This is accomplished through innovative classroom and online courses on power distribution systems, introducing undergraduate students and underrepresented minority students to challenging interdisciplinary problems, and targeted outreach to high-school students.  <br/><br/>The overarching goal of this CAREER project is to realize the full potential of the emerging distribution grid to manage rarely occurring disruptions that are high-impact low-probability (HILP) events by decentralization of infrastructure and operations. The core idea is that enhanced resilience will be attained through innovations in employing DERs for islanded operation and allowing distributed decision-making during a disaster situation. The project goals are achieved by (1) strategic resource planning to enhance the ability to restore critical services using DERs; (2) distributed decision-making for DER-driven service restoration that allows for a faster service recovery during a disaster; and (3) characterizing graph-theoretic and algebraic conditions that relate to the small-signal stability of DER energized islands and their design parameters; these conditions are used to guide service restoration process such that the restored islands are not only operationally feasible but also stable. The novelty of our approach stems from a closely interwoven planning and operational framework that prioritizes the use of DERs to enable new and transformative ways of operating the power distribution grid during disruptions. Theoretical contributions are expected on the characterization of HILP events towards resilience and risk-averse planning methods; distributed optimization methods for a combinatorial, non-convex, and large-scale problem for service restoration; the analytical characterization of network-level properties for a lossy DER energized island that relates to its small-signal stability; and implications of structural properties and design parameters on the stability of low-inertia systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One such example is electric power distribution systems, where the massive integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) and flexible loads motivates new decision-making paradigms via demand response through user engagement. This project introduces a novel approach for intelligent decision making in power distribution systems to efficiently leverage flexible demand commitments in highly uncertain and stochastic environments. The project goals are to (1) develop analytics required to enable actionable demand-side flexibility from several small consumers by adequately representing their constraints regarding electricity usage and their interactions with the system and the energy provider; and (2) develop a prototype for demand-side coordination using an open-source testbed for distribution systems management and evaluate the proposed algorithms with real-world utility data. Successful completion of this project will provide solutions to adaptive and smart infrastructure systems in which passive users turn into active participants. For the demand response focus here, this project will enable high levels of penetration of flexible loads and DERs economically through the transformation of grid operation from load following to supply following. The results from this project will provide valuable guidance to policymakers and electric utilities in managing aggregator-driven markets. <br/><br/>The central aim of this proposal is to enable the demand-side participation of many small customers in a distribution grid and solve for an interface between customers and an energy provider. The proposed architecture follows a two-level structure:  a home energy management system (HEMS) providing a home-level interaction between the consumer and the HEMS, and a feeder-level interaction between the HEMS and the demand-response provider. Research along two thrusts will be proposed: (1) learning-based control to achieve home-level flexibility upon learning and incorporating customer constraints and preferences into the decision-making process; and (2) game-theoretic constructs to aggregate and coordinate the home-level flexibility at the network-level in a constrained environment with unknown customer utility functions. Technical innovations at the HEMS-customer interface will include automata learning-based algorithms used by HEMS to learn customers? temporally evolving energy usage constraints, and reinforcement learning algorithms to satisfy temporal constraints while optimizing the cost of electricity consumption. At the provider-HEMS interface, technical innovations will include a new mean field based model of customers that allows the provider to interact with only a few customer classes, and a Stackelberg game formulation that explicitly incorporates network congestion constraints.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
