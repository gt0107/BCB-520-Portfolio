Many centersfocus on a single disease or organ system. By contrast the Center for Modeling Complex Interactions focuseson an approach that can address many biomedical problems: team-based interdisciplinary research centeredaround modeling. Our goal is to support and facilitate biomedical discovery by integrating modeling intointerdisciplinary research. Modeling improves research at all stageshypothesis formulation experimentaldesign analysis and interpretation. It provides a unifying language by which exchange of ideas can highlightcommonalities and uncover unforeseen connections between problems. Formalization of ideas into thisunifying language also improves rigor and reproducibility. We define modeling broadly to include everythingfrom deterministic and stochastic mathematical approaches to physical and computational models of three-dimensional objects to agent-based and machine learning approaches where exact solutions are not possible.We seek to support modelers by increasing their numbers and by giving them opportunities to play oninterdisciplinary teams. We seek to support empiricists by giving them access to relevant modeling expertiseand by creating a community and a culture to facilitate interdisciplinary research. In Phase I the Center forModeling Complex Interactions created the intellectual cultural and physical environment to promote team-based interdisciplinary research. In Phase II we will build on that foundation by maintaining a stronginterdisciplinary culture to foster collaboration among people who might otherwise never connect and byadding additional faculty to expand our modeling expertise. We have four Aims: 1) Support faculty to carry outmodel-based interdisciplinary biomedical research and increase their competitiveness for external funding.Research in the Center is carried out in the context of Working Groupszero-barrier interdisciplinary goal-focused teams that meet regularly to get work done. Supported research includes three Research ProjectsPilot Projects Modeling Access Grants and ad hoc teams. Our comprehensive plan for proposal preparationimproves grantsmanship and our staff assists with submission and grant management. 2) Increase Universityof Idahos faculty participation in biomedical research. We will add six new faculty as a commitment to thisPhase II COBRE and attract broader participation from across the University. 3) Extend the reach of theModeling Core into new areas of modeling to capitalize on emerging opportunities. The Modeling Coreaccelerates interdisciplinary research by placing Core Fellows at the hub of the research community. We haveadded new Core Initiatives in machine learning and geospatial modeling to stimulate research in these areaswith high potential for future growth. 4) Establish a path to long-term sustainability under the umbrella of theInstitute for Modeling Collaboration & Innovation. The major hurdle for sustainability is to maintain a robustModeling Core. We have developed a business plan that calls for us to diversify our funding sources to includeinstitutional state and private support to supplement federal grants.","266181",

This Team Science Supplement Dynamic Cellular Events in Assembling theVertebrate Eye will advance this goal by bringing together three University of Idaho (UI) investigators withcomplementary expertise in developmental neurobiology immunology/glial biology/imaging and imageanalysis/computer vision to address a key knowledge gap in biomedical science. Project co-directors will focuson the development of the vertebrate eye and therefore will be directly in alignment with the Cell Signalingscientific theme of the Idaho INBRE-4 Program as this organ carries out numerous developmental and functionalsignaling activities. This Supplement project will pursue the spatiotemporal dynamics of relationships amongneuronal progenitors neurons glia and non-nervous system cell types using live confocal imaging of developingzebrafish embryos and novel means of image/video analysis. The project will generate reference static anddynamic atlases of vertebrate eye development over the time of retinal development/differentiation and createimage and video analysis tools for the vision science community for systematic and quantitative comparison ofeye phenotypes. These resources will be made publicly accessible and interactive and will utilize the INBRE DataScience Core facility at the UI. This Core and its infrastructure were or are supported by IDeA (COBRE andINBRE) awards and institutionally by the UI. The three project co-directors DL Stenkamp DM Mitchell and LNguyen all have strong research records and have mentored numerous trainees. This Supplement furthers theirteam approach and will provide preliminary data for future collaborative studies and competitive grant proposalscomplying with the goal of this funding Supplement. This team science approach will benefit each investigatorthrough their collective effort and bring new perspectives to address this key knowledge gap in developmentalbiology. The project research questions do not duplicate those currently being pursued by the parent IdahoINBRE-4 Program award. This Team Science Supplement to INBRE-4 encourages competitiveness that willcontinue to have an enduring impact on biomedical research and training in Idaho.","848625",

Bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria) are the numerically dominant members of animal microbiomes and they influence many properties of these communities. Bacteriophages regulate bacterial community composition by predation transfer genetic material between host genomes and beneficially stimulate the immune system of animals. However our knowledge of bacteriophages is largely restricted to a limited set of lab-adapted strains and thus our understanding of their role in animal microbiomes is lacking. Bacteriophages may influence disease through ecological processes by regulating bacterial community composition and abundance or by promoting changes in the virulence of their bacterial hosts. The factors causing microbial composition to change over time are often hard to determine and empirically test because most animal microbiomes are complex and experimental intractable. We propose to utilize an important animal model system the honey bee (Apis mellifera) to determine how ecological and evolutionary forces shape animal microbiomes. To this end we outline two Aims that will help us characterize these forces. Aim 1: Determine how phage resistance evolution is dependent on microbial growth conditions. In this aim we will comprehensively test different parameters of growth than are likely to influence how quickly bacteria evolve resistance against bacteriophage infections. We will carefully measure the tempo of change in sets of bacteria and phages growing together. We anticipate identifying how these dynamics are impacted by growth conditions. Aim 2: Measure the impact of microbial interactions on phage resistance evolution dynamics. In this aim we expand our research to include interacting bacterial species. In most natural conditions that microbes live in they will encounter other bacteria. These interactions likely alter how bacteria respond to and evolveresistance against the bacteriophages that infect them. Our experiments will address this by co-culturing bacteria and again measuring the tempo of evolution in these systems. In both aims we adopt an integrative approach that utilizes mathematic modeling culturing of bacteria and phages in the lab and testing their growth in the honey bee gut. In doing so we benefit from the strengths of each approach and increase the rigor of our results."," ",

Human vision requires that these pigments consisting of a chromophore and associated opsin protein have distinct peak spectral sensitivities in separate rod and cone photoreceptor populations. Peak spectral sensitivity is determined by the chromophore type and the amino acid sequence of the opsin. Understanding how a single mutation in the opsin protein can lead to anomalous visual function and disease would assist the development of molecular-level therapeutic strategies. Such an understanding is currently not available. The proposed research has an overarching goal of developing novel molecular-level therapeutic strategies to treat human vision deficiencies by unraveling the mysteries of the phototransduction cycle using state-of-the-art modeling approaches. The goal of the proposed research is to build on our molecular modeling framework to develop and test an automated computational pipeline to estimate peak spectral sensitivity for Rh1 rod opsins and use it to elucidate mechanisms for disease-associated mutations. In Aim 1 we will build a machine-learning-based pipeline which will utilize homology modeling and molecular dynamics simulation for accurately predicting peak spectral sensitivity from opsin amino acid sequence data. Aim 2 will employ mixed quantum mechanics / molecular mechanics simulations to elucidate molecular mechanisms of spectral shift and improve the pipeline. In Aim 3 we will use the pipeline to determine molecular mechanisms for anomalous visual functions. The proposed research has the potential for high impact in the field of human vision because it will provide a predictive modeling approach for visual pigments that has remained elusive for decades. This new genome-to-phenome understanding of the molecular function of visual pigments will pave the way for novel strategies to engineer pigments suitable for optogenetics or to develop targeted therapeutic strategies."," ",

This equipment will enhance the accessibility and impact of this IDeA-built core inthe Institute for Interdisciplinary Data Sciences (IIDS). The IIDS is the legacy of 20-years of NIHIDeA investment through both the INBRE and COBRE funding mechanisms and is nowindependent from NIH direct support. IIDS is one of three sites across Idaho that togethercomprise the Idaho INBRE Data Science Core and serves investigators statewide. In FY21IIDS core facilities supported the research of 83 faculty and 190 trainees from 9 differentColleges 30 academic departments and 10 centers and institutes. Of these 273 researchers70% of them relied in some way on computational infrastructure. IIDS is also a nexus ofstatewide collaboration offering services to all Idaho INBRE Network institutions. IIDS housesstate-of-the-art equipment high performance computing infrastructure secure data storage andtechnical expertise in bioinformatics data science and software engineering. The requestedequipment purchase will upgrade and enhance the previous and ongoing NIH IDeA investmentsin Idaho infrastructure equipment and faculty/staff related to bioinformatics high performancecomputing and data science. The addition represents necessary upgrades to our existingcapacity for secure data storage large scale bioinformatics analyses and hardware suitable forAI applications. We have experienced dramatic surges in demand for computation and datastorage and anticipate that this demand will grow further as Idaho INBRE research activityincreases. Our current data storage systems (900 Tb) are over 90% full and the proposedequipment will effectively double our capacity while simultaneously replacing aging equipment.In addition this equipment request will add critically needed capacity to accommodate theincrease in demand for genome assemblies using long read sequencing data from our Pac Biosequel II. Finally GPU cards will meet the growing demand for hardware suitable for deeplearning and other AI research a capacity not currently available at other sites within the IdahoINBRE network. Collectively this INBRE Administrative supplement will add importantequipment to enhance the capabilities for biomedical researchers state-wide.","204266",

Despite the great contributions ODEs have made to biology and beyond the high-dimensional time-dependent factors of the immune system still pose a significant challenge to the predictive value of ODEs as it would require several hundred equations and thousands of parameters to be estimated. The recent rise of machine learning as a powerful computational tool to integrate large datasets presents a special opportunity to deal with the inherent complexity of biological systems. However machine learning approaches do not consider the mechanistic knowledge of the underlying interactions. Preliminary studies that combine ODEs and machine learning highlight that these computational algorithms could be on the cusp of a major revolution. Remarkably enough however no parameter estimation theory exists to integrate simultaneously both approaches. We propose to create new hybrid models and test their predictions in a mouse viral coinfection system to address a central vexation for infection biology which is how and when to modulate immune responses to mitigate mortality during lethal respiratory viral infection. At the interface between mathematical and life sciences we will develop and analyze a novel suite of computational models that will integrate the underlying biological mechanisms to manage ill-posed problems and explore massive design spaces allowing for robust predictions from complex biological systems. To validate and test our novel and foundational mathematical approaches we will generate the biological data from a mouse infection system with a mild viral pathogen (rhinovirus) two days before infection with a lethal viral pathogen (influenza) that results in reduced disease compared to single infection alone. We hypothesize that this system can train our mathematical models in a natural way how the innate immune system can be manipulated to reduce mortality to lethal infections and beyond. Key model predictions will be tested by targeted immune system manipulation during lethal infection paving the way to understanding the role of complex immune interactions in respiratory viral disease pathology.","171789",

The INBRE-Developmental Research Program Investigator D. Xu and COBRE-projectinvestigator B. Morrison will combine their talents and expertise on a project titled Computer-aided drugdevelopment coupled with allergic response biology to identify novel therapeutics. The project brings togetherXus computational biochemistry expertise in computer-aided drug development and Morrisons cell andmolecular biology expertise in cell culture and immunology to investigate allergic hyperresponsivenesstherapeutics. The partnership will enhance the quality of scientific work for both investigators and increaseresearch opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students. Allergic hyperresponsiveness is a commonand debilitating health issue that results in a reduced quality of life and increased mortality. Prime examplesinclude asthma affecting ~26 million people in the U.S. and atopic dermatitis affecting >18 million people inthe U.S. The investigators are focusing their efforts on IL-13RA1 a key receptor in allergic responses for whichthere is no efficacious drug to block the negative effects of receptor binding. Strong preliminary data supportsthe project. Using two INBRE Data Science Core facilities a high-power in silico screen of NIH compoundlibraries coupled with cell culture validation they found 40 potential drug candidates that inhibit the IL-13RA1/IL-4R complex. Among these candidates they identified a lead compound nicotinamide hypoxanthinedinucleotide referred to as Drug 4. Their goals will be to first expand the hit-to-lead search using 2Dmolecular fingerprint and 3D pharmacophore to screen ~1 million compounds against Drug 4. Identifiedcompounds will be optimized using 3D visualization driven ligand design free energy-based quantitativestructure-activity relationship (QSAR) and computational absorption disposition metabolism excretion andtoxicity (ADMET) analyses. Second Drug 4 specificity for human IL-13RA1/IL-4R signaling will be determinedin cell culture. Receptor signaling will be tested using a lentiviral shRNA knockdown approach in human A549lung carcinoma cells. If disrupted inhibition of ligand binding will be confirmed in the mouse cell line 3T3-L1that expresses and responds to both IL-13 and IL-4. This strategy will be applied for all drug candidatesidentified. The Xu-Morrison collaboration has strong institutional support and will use lDeA-built research corelaboratories. Two INBRE-initiated research cores will be used in this project the Biomolecular ResearchCenter at Boise State University and the Molecular Research Core Facility at Idaho State University.","190515",

Compromised mental cognitive and emotionalhealth is common in US women during the perinatal period and those living in the rural frontier and remoteWest are disproportionately affected. Factors underlying the high prevalence of these health disorders inwomen are complex but poor diet is a suspected prominent contributing factor. We propose a longitudinalrepeated-measured observational study of perinatal women living in Idaho Montana and Wyoming. We willtest the hypotheses that 1) perinatal dietary patterns of women in the rural frontier and remote West vary bykey demographic variables (e.g. household income) and 2) women consuming certain dietary patterns havebetter mental cognitive and emotional wellbeing assessments compared to those consuming other types ofdiets. These hypotheses will be tested in two specific aims. The first aim will use validated tools to characterizeacute and chronic perinatal dietary patterns of the study subjects and determine if variation in these patterns isrelated to household income and other key demographics. The second aim will use rigorous methodologies todocument associations between dietary patterns and perinatal maternal mental health cognitive function andemotional wellbeing. Identification of dietary patterns associated with better maternal neurological health is thefirst step in designing interventions to facilitate positive behavior changes and improve prenatal care. As suchthis study will provide foundational data to inform the design of and sample size calculations for future studies.This study will also increase the number of students with training in womens health-related biomedicalsciences and provide preliminary data for an R01 proposal. The long-term goal of our research program is toimplement nutrition education interventions to facilitate positive dietary and behavior changes and ultimatelyimprove nutritional and neurological health of women living in the rural frontier and remote West.","260792",

We identified a large cohort of biology-interestedundergraduate students at NIC half of whom are from populations underrepresented (UR) in sciences. Thenumber of NIC students who transfer to complete a biomedical related bachelors degree at U of I is low (~35students per year) and there are few undergraduate research opportunities for NIC students. Surveys of NICstudents revealed barriers to transfer including lack of knowledge about degree plans and financial hardships.A self-assessment conducted at U of I identified undergraduate research-oriented departments and mentorswith experience supporting UR in science students. These self-studies are the basis for the proposed five-year project to increase the number and diversity of students in biomedical research by partnering NICstudents with U of I faculty mentors. To do so we will pursue two program objectives: 1) increase the numberof NIC to U of I transfer students by 10% per year of the program (from 35 to 55+ per year over five years) and2) increase the graduation rate and matriculation of U of I UR students into graduate research programs by50% over baseline during the project period. Rationale: NIC currently offers only six research opportunities for>1800 biology-interested students and has a low go-on rate limiting the pipeline of UR students into graduateresearch programs and careers. The NI-B2B program will develop a pipeline program to increase the numberand diversity of students entering graduate research programs and careers. Research Training ProgramDesign: The program objectives will be met by achieving the following program goals: Aim 1. Increase thenumber and diversity of students pursuing biomedical research careers by developing a transferpathway for NIC students. We will integrate interdisciplinary Course-based Undergraduate ResearchExperiences (CURE) labs into existing NIC courses to promote transfer and completion of a four-year degree.The CURE course will also serve to introduce and recruit applicants into the NI-B2B program. Aim 2. ImmerseNI-B2B scholars in biomedical research experiences. We will immerse cohorts of 6 NIC students inbiomedical research experiences with a faculty mentor at U of I during the summers before and after bridgingto U of I. Aim 3. Prepare NI-B2B scholars for graduate studies by embedding them in a mentoredresearch environment and by helping students develop competitive graduate program applications.We will integrate students into a research team and a NI-B2B scholars cohort. Students will learn to conductindependent research in a mentored research environment and learn to interpret and communicate scientificresults as they consolidate a scientist identity. Students will prepare to take the GRE and learn to select anddevelop tailored graduate program applications as part of the NI-B2B cohort.","98616",

To seek solutionswe built a core centered on modeling. A good model gives insight into how a process works and moreimportantly how the process can be manipulated to promote human health. Modeling can serve as a commonlanguage to link disparate research areas; it improves research at every stage from hypothesis formulationthrough analysis. Ultimately modeling creates a positive feedback loop with empirical approaches deepeningscientific exploration and discovery. During Phase I we established the Modeling Core centered on a group ofCore Fellows: postdocs with diverse modeling expertise. Our Core is unique. In contrast to many other centersthat focus on a single biomedical problem we apply modeling to many biomedical problems and for each ofthese can bring multiple types of modeling to bear. Our Core is agile. We can modify our expertise based onthe needs of the Center and of the community. Our Core is catalytic. We have shaped interdisciplinaryresearch in tangible ways: providing modeling expertise to empiricists growing areas of modeling with highimpact and increasing the number of collaborative proposals and publications. Building on this upwardtrajectory our overarching goal is to enhance biomedical discovery across the University and the State byintegrating modeling into research via three aims. (1) Support individual Research Projects by engaging inintegrative modeling. We achieve this by ensuring that each project has significant effort from a Fellow andthrough our Core Initiative on machine learning that will benefit the projects directly. (2) Extend the ModelingCore into emerging research directions. The purpose of this aim is to anticipate and respond to the modelingneeds of the research community. This will be accomplished by hiring Fellows in new areas of modeling bygiving current Fellows development opportunities and by establishing two new Core Initiatives one in machinelearning and one in geospatial modeling. (3) Expand the impact of the Modeling Core across the University andState by recruiting more researchers in additional fields. The purpose of this aim is to grow the number ofparticipants to support the long-term sustainability of the Core and the Center. This will be accomplishedprimarily by embedding Core Fellows in interdisciplinary teams as well as by offering Modeling Access Grantsand training workshops. Completion of these aims will lead to a stronger Core that supports modeling effortsand improves biomedical research in Idaho. This will move us closer to our long-term goal of building asustainable Center."," ",

Many centersfocus on a single disease or organ system. By contrast the Center for Modeling Complex Interactions focuseson an approach that can address many biomedical problems: team-based interdisciplinary research centeredaround modeling. Our goal is to support and facilitate biomedical discovery by integrating modeling intointerdisciplinary research. Modeling improves research at all stageshypothesis formulation experimentaldesign analysis and interpretation. It provides a unifying language by which exchange of ideas can highlightcommonalities and uncover unforeseen connections between problems. Formalization of ideas into thisunifying language also improves rigor and reproducibility. We define modeling broadly to include everythingfrom deterministic and stochastic mathematical approaches to physical and computational models of three-dimensional objects to agent-based and machine learning approaches where exact solutions are not possible.We seek to support modelers by increasing their numbers and by giving them opportunities to play oninterdisciplinary teams. We seek to support empiricists by giving them access to relevant modeling expertiseand by creating a community and a culture to facilitate interdisciplinary research. In Phase I the Center forModeling Complex Interactions created the intellectual cultural and physical environment to promote team-based interdisciplinary research. In Phase II we will build on that foundation by maintaining a stronginterdisciplinary culture to foster collaboration among people who might otherwise never connect and byadding additional faculty to expand our modeling expertise. We have four Aims: 1) Support faculty to carry outmodel-based interdisciplinary biomedical research and increase their competitiveness for external funding.Research in the Center is carried out in the context of Working Groupszero-barrier interdisciplinary goal-focused teams that meet regularly to get work done. Supported research includes three Research ProjectsPilot Projects Modeling Access Grants and ad hoc teams. Our comprehensive plan for proposal preparationimproves grantsmanship and our staff assists with submission and grant management. 2) Increase Universityof Idahos faculty participation in biomedical research.

Humans do not possess thisregenerative capacity both in contexts of acute retinal damage or in neurodegenerative diseases of the retinaalthough microglia and macrophages are active participants in the response to neuronal death andmacrophages are able to drive wound healing in peripheral tissues. Further in some contexts microglia andmacrophages appear to contribute to pathology though modulation of such pathological contributions has notbeen achieved. In order to provide future therapeutic and regenerative strategies to support endogenousmicroglia/macrophage-specific mechanisms that positively regulate the outcome of regeneration and/or impartthe capacity to perform such functions through strategic manipulation more foundational knowledge isrequired. We propose that a thorough understanding of microglia and macrophage functions in a system ofrobust retinal regeneration (specifically the zebrafish) will reveal microglia and macrophage functions that canultimately be harnessed to mitigate neuroinflammation and support attempts at retinal regeneration in humans. Our published and preliminary data indicate that in zebrafish both retinal resident microglia and extra-retinally derived macrophages are present in degenerating and regenerating retinal tissue following an acutecytotoxic lesion and these microglia/macrophages intimately interact with regenerative Mller glia the cell typeacting as the source of regenerated neurons. Transcriptional profiling of microglia/macrophages during activeMller glia-mediated regeneration indicates functional changes in microglia/macrophages compared to steady-state. Our preliminary data also indicate that altering microglial phenotype to a pro-inflammatory state maycontribute to neuronal degeneration. We hypothesize that microglia and macrophages perform crucialfunctions in shaping the outcome of retinal degeneration and regeneration. The following Specific Aims will testthis hypothesis. 1. Determine the extent and duration of microglia and macrophage heterogeneity followingretinal injury. 2. Determine how pro-inflammatory macrophages affect retinal degeneration and regeneration. 3.Determine endogenous function(s) of microglia and macrophages in retinal regeneration. Findings from thisproposal will (I) provide crucial knowledge and tools towards future research to identify microglia vs.macrophage-specific molecular mechanisms underlying retinal degeneration and successful regeneration and(II) facilitate comparative studies to identify key factors and mechanisms that determine outcome (pathologyvs. regeneration) following retinal damage in zebrafish compared to mammals. Collectively this newknowledge will provide foundations towards successful design and application of therapeutic strategies forhuman retinal damage and disease.","359164",

A new approach to reducing the threat of spillover is to eliminatethe pathogen from its animal reservoir using transmissible vaccines that move from animal toanimal providing immunity to the pathogen as they go. Transmissible vaccines reduce thevaccination effort required for pathogen control within animal reservoirs and allow the vaccineto penetrate remote reservoir habitats where direct vaccination is impossible. Bringing thisrevolutionary idea to fruition requires that we engineer vaccines that simultaneously: 1)transmit efficiently from animal to animal 2) stimulate a robust immune response to the targetpathogen and 3) maintain their integrity in the face of evolutionary pressures. This project willdevelop mathematical models that predict how these traits of the vaccine emerge from theinterplay between vaccine replication and the animals immune response. These models will beparameterized and validated using laboratory studies of prototype transmissible vaccines thatuse murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) as a vector backbone. We focus on MCMV as a vectorbecause it is highly species specific capable of superinfection and provides a model for vaccinedevelopment across murine rodents that serve as important reservoirs for a wide range ofhuman pathogens. The models will be validated using experiments with immune depleted micethat challenge their ability to explain both pattern and process.

They are reliant on a de-velopmental cycle consisting of three cell forms termed the reticulate body (RB) the intermediate body (IB) andthe elementary body (EB). The EB is infectious but does not replicate. The RB replicates in the host cell but isnon-infectious while the IB is an intermediate form that transitions to the EB form. Completion of this develop-mental cycle is central to chlamydial pathogenesis. Within this order the genus Chlamydia contains thecausative agents of a number of important pathogens of humans. C. psittaci causes zoonotic infections result-ing in pneumonia while C. pneumoniae is a human pathogen that causes respiratory disease and is linked toatherosclerosis. Biovars of C. trachomatis are the causative agents of trachoma the leading cause of pre-ventable blindness worldwide as well as the sexually transmitted disease Chlamydia. Irrespective of the result-ing disease all chlamydial species share the same obligate intracellular life cycle and developmental cycle.The chlamydial developmental cycle reacts to environmental stresses by exiting the developmental cycle andforming aberrant cell forms and delaying the production of infectious EBs. These cell forms can then reenterthe productive developmental cycle when the environmental stress is lifted. It is hypothesized that this re-sponse to stress conditions contributes to the clinical observation that chlamydial infections are often chronic orreoccur in a significant number of diagnosed cases. We have developed a live-cell reporter system to followcell-type switching in real time at the single inclusion level and determined that Chlamydias response to stressconditions such as peptidoglycan inhibitors or nutrient stress differs between treatments and over time. Treat-ment with peptidoglycan inhibitors results in a block in RB to IB development creating aberrant polyploid RBs.These aberrant cells express the RB reporter for ~ 10 hours prior to expressing the IB reporter but never ex-press EB reporters or gain infectivity. Nutrient stress such as tryptophan and iron starvation are also reportedto cause Chlamydia to exit the productive developmental cycle and form aberrant RBs. Our live cell datasuggests that these cells do not exhibit the same phenotype as those treated with peptidoglycan inhibitors.Therefore Aim 1 will Determine the phenotype and gene expression profile of aberrant RBs that reacti-vate to produce infectious EBs. IB to EB development is a slow process taking ~10 hours until maximal EBreporter gene expression. We therefore hypothesize that the IB may respond to nutrient stress by halting de-velopment until the nutrient stress is resolved. The IB then could reenter the developmental state producinginfectious progeny. Therefore Aim 2 will Determine the contribution of the IB to EB transition in persis-tence.","181821",

One of the most common reason for lactation cessation is mastitis (inflammation of the breast). Mastitis is also a significant concern for the US dairyindustry because not only does it represent a significant challenge to animal welfare but it also decreases milkproduction and is the most common reason animals are treated with antibiotics. Despite decades of researchmastitis prevention and treatment are poorly understood in both species. One reason for this is that althoughmastitis has historically been attributed to the presence of bacterial pathogens in the mammary gland thisdogma is now known to be incorrect. Modern advances in the use of DNA sequencing (rather than needing togrow bacteria in culture media) have resulted in a paradigm shift in this regard such that researchers now knowthat all milk produced by both healthy and mastitic cows and women contains a rich community of microbes.Experts now believe that a dysbiosis in these microbes or a shift in their metabolism causes mammary inflammation. Consequently we must now re-examine everything we thought we knew about the etiology and riskfactors for this disease. Fundamental to filling this research gap is the rigorous characterization of the microbiome in milk produced by healthy and mastitic women and cows; and identification of microbial community fingerprints and metabolomic modifiers thereof that alter risk of mammary inflammation. In addition understanding the similarities and dissimilarities in mammary inflammation between cows and women will help researchers understand whether the former can be used as a model for the latter (and vice versa). The overallobjectives for this project are to 1) compare and contrast the milk microbiome its functionality immune parameters and inflammatory markers in healthy and mastitic women and cows and 2) identify milk microbial profiles and their functionality related to risk for mammary inflammation. Our central hypotheses are that 1) mammary inflammation in both species is associated with shifts in microbes and their function concentrations ofselected markers of immunity and mammary inflammation and that 2) there exist detectable milk microbiomepatterns (or functions) that predispose some women and cows to increased risk of inflammation and thesepatterns are related to (and perhaps modified by) environmental and behavioral parameters some of which arecurrently considered risk factors for mastitis. To test these hypotheses we will compare healthy and mastiticcows and women (case-control design) during the first 6 wk postpartum (longitudinal repeated-measures design during a high-risk period in both species). Importantly we will utilize a multi-omics approach and machinelearning to understand complex relationships within and between species. The results of this work will lead tobetter understanding of how the microbiology of the lactating mammary gland is related to mammary inflammation and will lay the groundwork for future studies to determine how this disease can be prevented and treated.","428581",

The emergence of these multi-drug resistant(MDR) pathogens is largely due to the sharing of resistance genes by plasmid mediated horizontal genetransfer. Bacterial plasmids are mobile genetic elements that can confer resistance to a variety of antibioticsincluding those that are considered to be drugs of last resort. Our long-term goal is to aid the developmentof strategies that can slow the spread of antibiotic resistance by gaining insight into the co-evolutionaryprocesses that allow bacteria to improve the persistence of newly acquired MDR plasmids. Newly acquiredresistance plasmids often do not persist in the absence of antibiotics but we and others have shown thatsingle mutations in the bacterial host the plasmid or both can rapidly improve this persistence. We and othersalso identified critical mutations in chromosomally encoded accessory helicases. Plasmid-helicase interactionsin bacteria may therefore be key to the ability of bacterial pathogens to retain newly acquired MDR plasmids.Unfortunately the molecular mechanisms that explain the positive effects of these mutations on plasmidpersistence are unknown. Importantly we also showed for the first time that these mutations pre-adapt thebacteria to other MDR plasmids that they acquire later in time leading to their enhanced persistence (referredto as increased plasmid permissiveness). This suggests that bacteria with increased permissiveness can serveas stable repositories for multiple MDR plasmids eventually generating strains with an expanded arsenal ofresistance genes. This possibility has never been tested. Using molecular techniques experimental evolutionand mathematical modeling we propose to test the following hypotheses: (i) chromosomal mutations can pre-adapt bacteria to other plasmids leading to greater plasmid permissiveness; (ii) plasmid permissiveness canexpand the spectrum of antibiotic resistance traits within a bacterial species; and (iii) accessory helicases arelinked to the persistence of newly acquired MDR plasmids across a wide spectrum of bacterial pathogens. Thiswill be done through achieving the following Specific Aims: (1) Test the generality of (i) increased plasmidpermissiveness after host/plasmid coevolution and (ii) helicase mutations as a mechanism of hostadaptation to novel MDR plasmids.; (2) determine the effects of plasmid persistence andpermissiveness on the emergence of expanded drug resistance; (3) determine the molecularmechanism of plasmid cost amelioration resulting from mutations in accessory helicases. If ourhypotheses are supported by our data mutations that stabilize one plasmid could lead to improved persistenceof other plasmids and expand the arsenal of resistance genes in the same cell.

In this renewal we focus upon mechanisms regulatingdifferential expression of the cone visual pigment genes on tandemly-replicated gene arrays. In humansa tandemly-replicated array on the X chromosome consists of one long wavelength-sensitive (LWS) genefollowed by 1-9 medium wavelength-sensitive (MWS) genes which have diverged spectrally from LWS. Thisrecent replication has provided most humans with trichromatic color vision because LWS MWS and SWS1opsins are uniquely expressed in separate cone populations. Heritable defects in the LWS/MWS array result invarious forms of color blindness X-linked retinal degenerations and Bornholm Eye Disease a conedysfunction associated with high myopia. Insights into regulation of differential expression of LWS vs. MWSopsins could allow therapeutic manipulation of gene expression to treat these disorders. In addition futureregenerative approaches to the treatment of other retinal disorders that involve the loss of cones (age-relatedmacular degeneration; Stargardts disease) would ideally include similar in vitro or in vivo manipulations togenerate cone phenotypes in ratios that support high-acuity color vision. The widely-accepted model for human LWS vs. MWS opsin regulation states that a stochastic eventfavors an association of an upstream regulatory region with the LWS or most proximal MWS. Howevertopographic patterns of the LWS:MWS ratio suggest that a nonrandom trans regulatory mechanism may beinvolved. Pursuit of regulatory mechanisms has been challenging because within mammals only primategenomes contain tandem opsin arrays. In contrast the genomes of teleost fish including zebrafish containnumerous tandem arrays of opsins which are the consequences of independent gene replication events andneofunctionalization. In our published and preliminary data we demonstrate that in zebrafish thedevelopmental signaling molecules retinoic acid (RA) and thyroid hormone (T3) can each control differentialexpression of the tandem duplicates LWS1 vs. LWS2 an array orthologous to the human LWS/MWS array.Furthermore compelling preliminary data suggest that RA can promote expression of LWS opsin in humaniPSC-derived 3D retinal organoids changing the ratio of LWS:MWS. Together these findings lay thegroundwork for a tremendous breakthrough in understanding determination of LWS vs. MWS cone subtype. In this renewal we pursue mechanisms through which RA and T3 control differential expression oftandemly replicated opsins and apply this knowledge to retinal regeneration and human retinal organoiddevelopment with three Specific Aims: 1. Determine the relative roles of RA and T3 signaling and theirreceptors as endogenous regulators of differential expression of tandemly replicated opsin genes. 2.Determine mechanisms through which RA and T3 signaling regulate tandemly replicated opsin genes. 3.Determine roles of RA and T3 signaling for controlling cone fates during retinal regeneration and in humaniPSC-derived 3D retinal organoids. These studies will uncover novel mechanisms for the differential expressionof tandemly replicated opsin genes and will generate information necessary to manipulate cone phenotypicfates in concert with the application of regenerative or cell replacement therapies for human retinaldegenerations.","356356",

The emergence of these multi-drug resistant(MDR) pathogens is largely due to the sharing of resistance genes by plasmid mediated horizontal gene transfer.Bacterial plasmids are mobile genetic elements that can confer resistance to a variety of antibiotics includingthose that are considered to be drugs of last resort. Our long-term goal is to aid the development of strategiesthat can slow the spread of antibiotic resistance by gaining insight into the co-evolutionary processes that allowbacteria to improve the persistence of newly acquired MDR plasmids. Newly acquired resistance plasmids oftendo not persist in the absence of antibiotics but we and others have shown that single mutations in the bacterialhost the plasmid or both can rapidly improve this persistence. We and others also identified critical mutationsin chromosomally encoded accessory helicases. Plasmid-helicase interactions in bacteria may therefore be keyto the ability of bacterial pathogens to retain newly acquired MDR plasmids. Unfortunately the molecularmechanisms that explain the positive effects of these mutations on plasmid persistence are unknown. Importantlywe also showed for the first time that these mutations pre-adapt the bacteria to other MDR plasmids that theyacquire later in time leading to their enhanced persistence (referred to as increased plasmid permissiveness).This suggests that bacteria with increased permissiveness can serve as stable repositories for multiple MDRplasmids eventually generating strains with an expanded arsenal of resistance genes. This possibility has neverbeen tested. Using molecular techniques experimental evolution and mathematical modeling we propose totest the following hypotheses: (i) chromosomal mutations can pre-adapt bacteria to other plasmids leading togreater plasmid permissiveness; (ii) plasmid permissiveness can expand the spectrum of antibiotic resistancetraits within a bacterial species; and (iii) accessory helicases are linked to the persistence of newly acquiredMDR plasmids across a wide spectrum of bacterial pathogens. This will be done through achieving the followingSpecific Aims: (1) Test the generality of (i) increased plasmid permissiveness after host/plasmidcoevolution and (ii) helicase mutations as a mechanism of host adaptation to novel MDR plasmids.; (2)determine the effects of plasmid persistence and permissiveness on the emergence of expanded drugresistance; (3) determine the molecular mechanism of plasmid cost amelioration resulting frommutations in accessory helicases. If our hypotheses are supported by our data mutations that stabilize oneplasmid could lead to improved persistence of other plasmids and expand the arsenal of resistance genes inthe same cell. Our findings will aid the development of new therapies aimed at slowing down the spread ofantibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogens.","81190",

Annually 1% of newborns are congenitally infected with HCMV. Five to10% of these infants are symptomatic at birth displaying a broad spectrum of central and peripheralnervous system (CNS and PNS) disorders including microcephaly mental retardation and sensorineuralhearing loss (SNHL). The most severe manifestations may be due to lytic infection of neural progenitor cells(NPCs) as seen in tissue culture. The improper/abnormal differentiation of infected NPCs and neurons mayalso contribute to birth defects. The host immune response to HCMV infection may impact delicate CNSand PNS tissues during gestation. However the development of SNHL during early childhood in infantsasymptomatic at birth is perplexing. For the thousands of children and their families affected annually thereis a critical need to determine the source of HCMV-induced birth defects to aid in their prevention andtreatment. Our long term goal is to translate our in vitro tissue culture findings into elucidating HCMV'scellular interactions contributory to HCMV-induced birth defects. Our objective in this proposal is todetermine if HCMV's specific interactions at two chromosome 1 loci and the resulting downregulation ofnidogen 1 (NID1) at 1q42 and myelin protein zero (MPZ) at 1q23 promote malfunctions in the CNS andPNS. We find expression of both proteins is downregulated in infected clinical tissue samples. NID1 isessential to the developing brain for neuronal migration and neural network excitability and plasticity. Wefind expressed NID1 protein is actively degraded post infection. Expression of the HCMV tegument proteinpp71 induces breaks at both sites and downregulates NID1. pp71 and the insulator protein CTCF are boundat the 1q42 breaksite and the NID1 promoter. NID1 protein levels are also reduced after infection with app71 deletion virus (AD169del71) indicating at least one additional viral protein regulates NID1. HCMVtargets NID1 with two viral proteins via two pathways suggesting NID1's elimination delivers strong selectiveadvantage to the virus. MPZ is the principal nerve sheath protein of the PNS. Mutations in MPZ are causallylinked to late onset SNHL. MPZ expression being limited solely to Schwann cells of the PNS which seemsunlikely could offer any selective advantage to the virus is strong evidence that MPZ regulation is off-target.Deficiencies in NID1 and MPZ could have severe ramifications during development. We hypothesize HCMVspecifically downregulates NID1 to promote dispersal of infected cells via remodeling of the extracellularmatrix in infected blood vessels and that similarity in sequence shared between the 1q42 and1q23 sitesleads to an off-target interaction with the 1q23 locus downregulating MPZ potentially leading to SNHL. Wewill determine 1) how HCMV downregulates NID1 2) the benefit HCMV derives from this downregulation 3)if MPZ is regulated in the same manner and 4) what are the ramifications of NID and MPZ downregulation?","362003",

Bacteremic children and adults are difficult to identifyand many have blood infections with isolates that are multi-antibiotic-resistant. The high occurrence ofbacteremia suggests that malaria induces a leaky gut an intestinal barrier dysfunction that facilitates escapeof bacteria from the gut lumen into the blood with resulting serious sequelae. Recent studies havedocumented allergic inflammation in malaria but no studies to date have linked this phenomenon to increasedintestinal permeability observed in both acute and resolving clinical malaria. Our published and preliminarystudies suggest that malaria-induced innate signals including early cytokine synthesis and basophil activationlead to mast cell influx into the intestine. Here activated mast cells damage the physical barrier and suppresshost immune responses that limit spread of enteric bacteria that cross the damaged physical barrier. In thesestudies we will use our established models to examine the contributions of early innate signals and basophils cells for which no function in malaria has been described  in promoting mastocytosis and the leaky gutphenotype we have observed. We will also determine to what extent malaria-induced mast cell degradation ofthe physical and immunological barriers of the intestine is dependent on mast cell proteases and mast cell-derived cytokines that are relevant to our observations. It is our expectation that our work will elucidate newmechanisms underlying the importance of allergic inflammation to mucosal barrier degradation in malaria. Theoutcome of the proposed research is likely to provide novel paradigms for future interventions to reduce theincidence of malaria-associated bacteremia. This work is significant because it directly addresses an importantco-morbidity of malaria and will provide novel mechanistic insights into well-documented  and heretoforeunlinked  clinical observations.

Methods that allowrapid development of vaccines are vital. Synonymous recoding of viral genomes is a recently developed generaland highly promising strategy for producing live attenuated vaccines. From an antigenic perspective the methodis ideal because it leaves the amino acid sequence of the viral proteins identical to the circulating pathogenicform. A number of viruses have been attenuated by recoding with non-preferred codons or codon pairs and atleast eight studies have shown protective immunization of mice. Despite its demonstrated success there arefundamental gaps in our knowledge: 1) no effort has been made to compare alternative recoding strategieswithin the same virus in the same study; 2) several potential methods of synonymous recoding have not beentested at all; 3) the way in which attenuation is affected by the combination of multiple recoded genes is notknown; and 4) most importantly it is unresolved whether viruses attenuated by synonymous recoding are robustto evolutionary recovery. This proposal tackles these gaps through three Specific Aims. Aim 1: Identify methodsof synonymous recoding and associated sequence features that can be used to generate viral genomes with atargeted level of attenuation. This aim includes developing empirical measures of individual codon and codonpair effects on translation rate to guide attenuation. It will also test metrics that have not previously been usedfor synonymous recoding. Aim 2: Extend models of adaptive evolution to determine if the attenuating effectswithin and among genes and transcripts combine in additive or non-additive ways. Aim 3: Determine if somestrategies of attenuation are more robust to recovery than others. This aim will focus on viruses attenuated inmultiple regions and by multiple methods and also determine if some recovery pathways are broadly beneficial.The project takes advantage of a bacteriophage model system with well-developed tools for genomemanipulation and methods for rapid experimental evolution relative to eukaryotic viral systems (i.e. a hundredgenerations per day at very large population sizes). Achieving these three aims will yield approaches that canbe applied to other systems for designing viruses with targeted levels of attenuation that are robust toevolutionary recovery. This research is a critical step toward the long-term goal of achieving a general strategyfor fighting infectious diseases by precision design of live vaccines that do not re-evolve virulence when used inhumans.","290667",
