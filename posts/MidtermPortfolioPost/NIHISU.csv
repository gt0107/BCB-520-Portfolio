Inaddition many older individuals have difficulties understanding speech in background noisebeyond what would be expected based solely on their audiometric thresholds. There is afundamental need for improved diagnosis and treatment of speech understanding in noisedifficulties. This research program sets out to establish electrophysiological correlates ofspeech-in-noise understanding with the goal of supplementing speech-in-noise testing. Theassumption is that accurate perception in noise is dependent in part on the accuracy of neuralcoding of the auditory stimulus. By combining electrophysiological and behavioral informationwe can advance our understanding of perception-in-noise difficulties and predict outcomes indifficult-to-test individuals using physiological testing. The clinical significance of the research proposed is related directly to the ability topredict more accurately diagnose and more precisely treat perception-in-noise difficulties. Anelectrophysiological measure that predicts speech perception will allow for improvedassessment of difficult-to-test populations and provide information about the capacity of thatauditory system to encode certain stimuli. This will allow the clinician to tailor treatmentstrategies to the specific needs of the individual and to counsel patients more effectively interms of the expectations they should have and the benefit they should expect as a result ofspecific treatments. Therefore to further our understanding of signal-in-noise perception andneural coding we will use brainstem cortical and cognitive auditory evoked potentials andbehavioral speech understanding-in-noise measures with age and hearing impairment ascontinuous variables to characterize the effect sizes of various covariates and to improve ourunderstanding of the relationship between brain and behavioral measures.","251216",

Giventhe need for pathogenic bacteria to modulate CPS expression (thickness) among various host niches duringdisease progression we postulate here that available environmental factors such as metal ion micronutrientscan influence CPS production. The long-term goal is to help develop alternative metal-based antimicrobialtherapeutics for clinical treatment of bacterial diseases in humans. The overall objectives in this applicationwhich constitute the first step toward attainment of the long-term goal are to identify the molecularmechanisms by which cellular metal ion ratios specifically manganese (Mn) zinc (Zn) and calcium (Ca)influence CPS production while increasing exposure of undergraduates to research and enhancing IdahoState Universitys biomedical research enterprise. The central hypothesis is that metal ion micronutrientsregulate CPS biogenesis via direct modulation of enzyme activity in pathogenic bacteria using Streptococcuspneumoniae (Spn) as a Gram-positive model bacterium. The rationale for this project is that a mechanisticunderstanding of how cellular metal ion ratios regulate CPS expression levels would provide new opportunitiesfor the subsequent identification and development of targets for the design of novel interventions to treathuman pathogenic bacterial infections. To attain the overall objectives we will pursue the following specificaims: 1) Identify the mechanism(s) whereby bioavailable Mn/Zn ratios affect CPS production; and 2) Determinethe role of Ca in Mn homeostasis and CPS biogenesis. The first aim will assess the physiological andbiochemical impact of bioavailable Mn/Zn ratios on several Mn-utilizing enzymes involved in various arms ofthe Spn CPS biosynthetic pathway. The second aim will assess the impact of Ca/Mn ratios on the intracellularmetal landscape and CPS biosynthesis in coordination with RNAseq and proteomic analysis. The overallapproach combines classical microbiology techniques with modern day applications that span the interface ofbiology and chemistry thereby exposing undergraduates to interdisciplinary research techniques. Theresearch proposed in this application is innovative in the applicants opinion because it represents asubstantive departure from the status quo by focusing on the impact of overall cellular metal ion micronutrientratios and their capacity to regulate bacterial CPS biogenesis. The research proposed will also further theunderstanding of how cellular metal ion availability serve as signaling factors that influence global cellularchanges and cellular programing during pathogenesis. The proposed research is significant because it isexpected to provide a strong foundation for subsequent future design of mechanistic and alternative metal-based drug development strategies to combat human bacterial pathogens prone to exhibiting multidrugresistance.","320000",

Giventhe need for pathogenic bacteria to modulate CPS expression (thickness) among various host niches duringdisease progression we postulate here that available environmental factors such as metal ion micronutrientscan influence CPS production. The long-term goal is to help develop alternative metal-based antimicrobialtherapeutics for clinical treatment of bacterial diseases in humans. The overall objectives in this applicationwhich constitute the first step toward attainment of the long-term goal are to identify the molecularmechanisms by which cellular metal ion ratios specifically manganese (Mn) zinc (Zn) and calcium (Ca)influence CPS production while increasing exposure of undergraduates to research and enhancing IdahoState Universitys biomedical research enterprise. The central hypothesis is that metal ion micronutrientsregulate CPS biogenesis via direct modulation of enzyme activity in pathogenic bacteria using Streptococcuspneumoniae (Spn) as a Gram-positive model bacterium. The rationale for this project is that a mechanisticunderstanding of how cellular metal ion ratios regulate CPS expression levels would provide new opportunitiesfor the subsequent identification and development of targets for the design of novel interventions to treathuman pathogenic bacterial infections. To attain the overall objectives we will pursue the following specificaims: 1) Identify the mechanism(s) whereby bioavailable Mn/Zn ratios affect CPS production; and 2) Determinethe role of Ca in Mn homeostasis and CPS biogenesis. The first aim will assess the physiological andbiochemical impact of bioavailable Mn/Zn ratios on several Mn-utilizing enzymes involved in various arms ofthe Spn CPS biosynthetic pathway. The second aim will assess the impact of Ca/Mn ratios on the intracellularmetal landscape and CPS biosynthesis in coordination with RNAseq and proteomic analysis. The overallapproach combines classical microbiology techniques with modern day applications that span the interface ofbiology and chemistry thereby exposing undergraduates to interdisciplinary research techniques. Theresearch proposed in this application is innovative in the applicants opinion because it represents asubstantive departure from the status quo by focusing on the impact of overall cellular metal ion micronutrientratios and their capacity to regulate bacterial CPS biogenesis. The research proposed will also further theunderstanding of how cellular metal ion availability serve as signaling factors that influence global cellularchanges and cellular programing during pathogenesis. The proposed research is significant because it isexpected to provide a strong foundation for subsequent future design of mechanistic and alternative metal-based drug development strategies to combat human bacterial pathogens prone to exhibiting multidrugresistance.","88497",

A critical barrier to identifying and developing newdrug development targets is a knowledge gap regarding most essential processes and regulatorypathways. Ideally new targets should be highly conserved and be unable or have limited abilityto mutate in order to evolve resistance. Parasite mitochondrial function is critically essentialacross all the life stages and differs substantially from the human organelle; however mostmitochondrial proteins have yet to be identified in malaria parasites. During the intraerythrocyticdevelopment cycle (IDC) P. falciparum is supported by a single mitochondrion containing about~20 copies of the 6 kb genome characterized by extensive recombination. IDC parasitemitochondria do not make cristae to insert electron transport chain (ETC) enzymes thus theorganelle may have evolved unique transcription or translation repression systems to limitexpression of the mitochondrial encoded genes. Results from our integrative approach combiningwhole genome sequencing and metabolic profiling suggests a link between mitochondrial geneexpression regulation and resistance to ETC inhibitors potentially due to recombination. Thuswe hypothesize that 1) a feature of the multicopy status is retention of cryptic mitochondrialgenome copies encoding mutant alleles which can be recombined for survival. 2) P. falciparummitochondria use previously uncharacterized gene expression systems for repression andactivation which are unique to this organelle. The current objectives are to identify the source ofrecombination between mitochondrial genomes and its contribution to drug resistance as well asto determine the mitochondrial DNA repair pathways and transcriptional machinery of themitochondria using single-organelle approaches. This proposal will identify and define previouslyunknown and uncharacterized aspects of parasite biology with the goal of advancing rationaldrug design. These studies will refine our knowledge about the basic mechanism of generegulation in the malaria mitochondria. Investigating the mechanisms underpinning these effectswill lead to the identification of highly conserved drug development targets.","351313",

The absence of these embryonic behaviors leads to seriousdecrements in muscle and lung function. Early motor behaviors can be studied in vitro in the form of rhythmicspontaneous neural activity (rSNA) carried in spinal and cranial nerve tracts. rSNA appears as regularoscillations that self-organize and propagate throughout the developing CNS. Over time signals that generaterSNA are anatomically and chemically refined to produce the specific and specialized motor circuits required atthe time of birth such as inspiration and expiration. Even though rSNA is uniquely positioned to provideinstructions that transform the output and connectivity of neural networks how rSNA is regulated and howelectrical activity assists in the functional maturation of motor circuits is still speculative. Moreover the ability ofrSNA to adapt to physiological signals via homeostatic ionic plasticity as well as the ramifications of plasticityfor embryonic health remain unknown. To explore this topic we will examine the neurophysiology of rSNA asit transforms into functional breathing-related motor activity within the altricial zebra finch hindbrain. Avianembryos are an ideal model to test principles of motor system development in all vertebrates and this projectexploits the in ovo developmental strategy of birds. Oviparity provides unparalleled access to developingneural circuits throughout incubation. Previously we showed that breathing-like motor activity could berecorded day-by-day from its onset through the establishment of ventilation at birth. We now know thatinspiratory and expiratory motor phases exhibit changes in temporal pattern during the embryonic periodwhich are correlated with changes in transmitter signaling. We found avian breathing circuits are similar tomammals in their anatomical location and neurotransmitter phenotypes establishing the bird model as a usefulexperimental tool. This renewal proposal will allow us to continue our investigations into the onsetmaintenance and plasticity of branchiomotor rhythms. Aim 1 will test mechanisms of CO2 and pH detection onbreathing-related motor behaviors day-by-day throughout motor circuit development. Published work from ourlaboratory shows that pH chemosensitivity influences spontaneous breathing patterns throughout incubationbut abruptly changes polarity (from inhibition to excitation) once air-breathing is established. We hypothesizethat fetal breathing-related patterns like adult ventilation are linked to signals through the maturation of GABAsynaptic transmission and chloride transport. Aim 2 will test how early primordial rhythms maintain intrinsicactivity levels and resist perturbations in neural activity. We will explore periods before air breathing begins.We will also test whether alterations in rSNA leads to errors in circuit formation and the functional maturation ofthe respiratory system both in vitro and in vivo. Importantly a major goal of this research is to inspire andexpose students at Idaho State University to key research questions in the field of respiratory neurobiology.","358752",
