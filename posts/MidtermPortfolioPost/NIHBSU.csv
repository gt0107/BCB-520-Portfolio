The thematic focus of matrix biology has allowed researchers to address some of the mostchallenging health concerns facing our nation. To date this centralized mechanism has supported sixteenjunior investigators seven as Research Project Investigators and nine at the Pilot Investigator level. The centerhas allowed us to capitalize on the broad diverse research base that exists at Boise State University. In PhaseII we propose to enhance and grow the COBRE in Matrix Biology program by building upon the programmaticinfrastructure that was established in Phase I through the Administrative Core. The primary goals of Phase II ofthe COBRE in Matrix Biology are to support investigators to enhance the productivity of junior mid-career andestablished scientists to facilitate collaboration between both junior and established researchers and to buildbiomedical research infrastructure at Boise State University. Major programmatic emphases of the COBRE inMatrix Biology are to support the analysis of animal models of relevance to cell-extracellular matrix interactionsin disease progression and tissue repair/regeneration and to provide access to research instrumentation andtechnical support. Through the Administrative Core the COBRE in Matrix Biology will sponsor careerdevelopment of junior investigators the establishment of new collaborations between investigators activitiesthat will promote the exchange of information ideas and reagents between COBRE members. We will continueto grow the center by recruiting non-members who are doing meritorious research within the thematic focus ofthe COBRE in Matrix Biology. The Administrative Core will continue to offer a pilot project program as arecruitment tool to provide funding to young and to established investigators who propose to apply theirexpertise to matrix biology.,

PROJECT SUMMARY - Role of Cellular Mechanotransduction of Low Intensity Vibrations in RegulatingExtracellular Matrix Synthesis1.1. Summarize the goal of the parent award: The long-term goal of the Center of Biomedical ResearchExcellence (COBRE) in Matrix Biology is to establish enhance and actively advance a multidisciplinary researchcenter focusing on improving our understanding of the role of the extracellular matrix in development healthand disease and contributing to the prevention treatment and cure for diseases of high priority. The specificaims of the COBRE Matrix Biology Parent award are: 1) enhance and grow upon the critical mass of investigatorsestablished around the thematic multidisciplinary focus of matrix biology 2) enhance biomedical research corecapabilities 3) grow research collaborations with existing programs and 4) enhance research trainingopportunities. This project will supplement the existing COBRE Matrix Biology award to form a new team ofinvestigators that bring together three investigators from IDeA states with different perspectives and expertise toaddress complex basic behavioral clinical and/or translational research questions with complementaryapproaches. The research question does not duplicate those currently being pursued by the parent award andclearly benefits from the collective efforts of the collaboration.1.2 Research question to be addressed by the supplement award: Engineering biophysical signals promisesnon-pharmacologic interventions to direct tissue regeneration in conditions that devastate bone such asosteoporosis aging injury bedrest or microgravity. Externally applied Low-Intensity Vibrations (LIV) amechanical signal similar to muscle activity offers a readily usable technology to stimulate Mesenchymal StemCell (MSC) anabolism for both tissue engineering and clinical approaches. LIV does not generate significantmatrix deformations in vivo thus excluding most mechano-transduction mechanisms previously proposed forhigh-magnitude and low-frequency mechanical signals (e.g. exercise). This presents a significant gapknowledge about bone mechanobiology and prevents utilization of LIV as an effective treatment for bone loss.MSCs ability to replace and rejuvenate bone cell populations are informed by both dynamic mechanical forcesgenerated during daily activities (e.g. muscle activity) and by the quality of the Extracellular Matrix (ECM). Yes1Associated Protein (YAP) is a transcriptional co-activator that can activate the expression of genes in responseto mechanical force including ECM molecules such as Connective Tissue Growth Factor (CTGF) to regulatecollagen production in cells. For tissue engineering and clinical approaches to ultimately succeed causativeinformation on how high-frequency signals generated by LIV are sensed transduced and eventually lead tonuclear YAP expression and ECM production is critical.This proposal aims to address a fundamental gap in bone mechanobiology by mechanistically establishing amechanosensory function of the cell nucleus to respond to dynamic accelerations produced by LIV. Using ournovel team approach we will test whether LIV generates relative motions of the nucleus within a cell tostrengthen nucleo-cytoskeletal scaffolding and to increase force-induced YAP signaling in the cell nuclei to elicitECM production. We will address this through three sub-hypotheses and specific aims.The aims of this study are to determine in live cells if 1) vibration frequency and acceleration modulate the LIV-induced nuclear motions and resulting F-actin remodeling 2) LIV-induced perinuclear F-actin remodeling willincrease cytoskeletal tension on the nucleus 3) the magnitude of cytoskeletal tension on the nucleus determinesthe magnitude of YAP nuclear entry and ECM production.Completion of these aims will provide knowledge on (1) how to enhance the efficacy of LIV-based regenerativemodalities in clinic and (2) foundational structure-function relationships in MSCs. Results will ultimately enableengineering LIV-based approaches that target nucleo-cytoskeletal connectivity with application in many areasincluding but not limited to tissue regeneration tissue engineering and aging.1.3 Benefit of team science effort: This proposed supplement cannot be accomplished by any singleinvestigator and requires an orchestrated effort by three investigators working in different fields: cellmechanobiology machine learning and computational biomechanics. Co-Project Lead (CPL) Uzer willwork on establishing experimental methods to measure nuclear motion high-fidelity cell and biological outcomesECM production and nuclear YAP levels. CPL Satici will focus on developing machine learning algorithms toreconstruct 3D nuclear and cytoskeletal geometries in response to LIV in live cells. CPL Fitzpatrick will developfinite element (FE) models to quantify cytoskeletal forces on the nucleus under LIV treatment. Upon successfulcompletion of this work our team will establish for the first time a novel pipeline for data-driven cell-specific FEmodels for understanding force-function relationships in cells. This novel method will lead us to new grantsubmissions to study the role of cell-specific forces in maintaining healthy cell function and ECM composition aswell as informing new translational studies that use LIV to attenuate disease progression both in vitro and in vivo.,723429

The premise that intra-cellular connectivitymaintained by Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton complexes may be the key aspect regulatingthe nuclear mechanotransduction is of paramount interest for potential therapeutic interventions andpoised to lay the foundation for novel advances in treatment and prevention of musculoskeletal declineas seen in aging obesity bedrest and other musculoskeletal conditions.,NIA,10829798,1/29/2024 0:00,PA-16-442,5R01AG059923-05,5,R01,AG,59923,5, ,"TSAP, LEONID V",3/1/2020 0:00,1/31/2025 0:00,Intercellular Interactions Study Section[ICI], ,14079481,"UZER, GUNES ",Not Applicable,2,ENGINEERING (ALL TYPES),72995848,HYWTVM5HNFM3,72995848,HYWTVM5HNFM3,US,43.603636,-116.201282,478201,BOISE STATE UNIVERSITY,BOISE,ID,BIOMED ENGR/COL ENGR/ENGR STA,837250001,UNITED STATES,N,2/1/2024 0:00,1/31/2025 0:00,866,Non-SBIR/STTR,2024,252208, ,NIA,184500,67708, ,Project Summary Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) in bone marrow provide regenerative capacity for bone replacing andreinforcing the skeleton at load bearing sites. When we age or in prolonged bedrest MSCs lose theirregenerative potential often measured by their proliferative and differentiation capacity. This loss of MSChealth causes osteoporosis and delayed healing ultimately resulting in decreased quality of life andincreased medical costs. A fundamental knowledge gap preventing effective therapies in aging and MSCrelated regenerative medicine is how aging and bedrest impedes MSC health. The nucleus central to all cellular activity relies on both mechanical input as well as its moleculartransducers to regulate intra-nuclear chromatin organization that ultimately determine cell function andfate. Thus failure to transmit this information to the nucleus would lead to the breakdown of theseprocesses. Here we ask if aging is a process that limits information flow into the nucleus ultimatelydiminishing its organizational capacity and responsiveness to outside stimuli. As we will show disablingthe mechanical connection between cytoskeleton and nucleus facilitated by Linker of Nucleoskeleton andNucleoskeleton (LINC) complexes impairs mechanosensitivity by affecting catenin and YAP/TAZsignaling. This leads to decreased proliferation and differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells.Our principal hypothesis is that loss of LINC-connectivity significantly contributes to MSC aging by disrupting nuclear mechanotransduction. Through this revision submitted in response to [PA16-442] - Changes in Cellular ArchitectureDuring Aging (R01) we will address our principal hypothesis through two specific aims each using adistinct hypotheses to examine how inhibiting LINC complex function as well as how aging related lossof LINC complex limits MSC mechanosignaling of known mechanotransducers catenin and YAP/TAZ.We will further determine the force-induced mechanisms of how sustained physical activity protects LINCcomplex expression to augment MSC and bone mechanosignaling within the context of aging.If successful we will establish for the first time a mechanistic understanding of how loss of LINC complexdrives decreased mechanosensory capability in aging. Completion of these aims will provide researchcommunities with (1) efficacy of LIV based regenerative modalities that improve LINC-mediatedmechanosignaling and (2) foundational structure-function relationship data in healthy and aged stemcells.,252208

By scanning a laser in a circle around a fluorescently labeled site of transcription in a confocalmicroscope we can measure fluorescence intensity at high speed for a very long time in living cells. Byfluorescent labeling DNA RNA and protein factors in different colors we can monitor complex assemblytranscription splicing and termination of RNA and the proximity of distal DNA elements like enhancers in theliving genome.Looking at nature in a new way or with a novel tool often reveals previously unknown details. This proposaldescribes such a project. Although much work has been done to study transcription splicing and terminationof RNA they have yet to be able to characterize a complete kinetic profile of how the RNA is synthesized froma gene and then released or when splicing occurs. With such a tool we may see much that was previouslyinvisible. We can begin to discern complex biochemical reactions that can only be measured in living cells.This research project will support interdisciplinary undergraduate graduate and postdoctoral trainees who willlearn advanced techniques in genome biology and single-molecule imaging shedding new light on thespatiotemporal dynamics of transcription and splicing.

AHLsynthases make AHL autoinducer signals by enzymatically coupling acyl-ACP/acyl-CoA and S-adenosyl-L-methionine metabolites to facilitate quorum sensing for the bacterium. Small molecule inhibitors of AHLsynthase enzymes would limit signal synthesis interrupt quorum sensing and thus hold significant promiseas chemical tools to investigate QS networks in bacteria. Designing AHL synthase-specific inhibitors howeverdoes remain a significant challenge. To develop AHL synthase selective inhibitors we recently embarked ona proof-of-concept study to evaluate the potential of AHL signal derivatives as product analog inhibitors ofPseudomonas aeruginosa RhlI AHL synthase. In this study we demonstrated that AHL analogs could serveas chemical probes to uncover novel inhibition and activation binding pockets that could be tapped to developpotent AHL synthase-specific modulators. In this grant application we extend this approach on a broaderscale to evaluate the utility of AHL analog chemical probes in discovering novel binding pockets determiningthe mechanistic basis of AHL synthase modulation and formulating the rules of AHL engagement in shortmedium and long-chain preferring AHL synthases. Additionally we will determine how the inhibition andactivation pockets could be leveraged to develop novel substrates and substrate analog inhibitors of AHLsynthases. Successful completion of these studies should inform the rational design of inhibition and activationpocket directed AHL synthase modulators.

AHL synthases make AHLautoinducer signals by enzymatically coupling acyl-ACP and S-adenosyl-L-methionine metabolites tofacilitate quorum sensing for the bacterium. Therefore AHL synthase inhibitors hold significant promise asantimicrobials in treating multidrug resistant bacterial infections. Designing AHL synthase specific inhibitorshowever does remain a significant challenge. To develop QS selective inhibitors we investigate uniquefunctional aspects of AHL synthases that distinguish them from other enzymes utilizing either acyl-ACP orSAM substrates. One such unique aspect of the synthase is its ability to selectively bind and react with aspecific acyl-ACP substrate thereby enforcing fidelity in AHL signal synthesis. In general acyl-ACP bindingto a partner enzyme is a minimal two-step process involving an initial electrostatic docking of ACP acidicresidues on to a basic patch in the synthase (protein-protein binding) followed by the translocation of the acyl-chain cargo from the ACP to the enzymes active site pocket through a process referred to as chain-flipping.Decoupling the binding from the chain-flipping step was not possible until now due to lack of methods thatcould independently report on the chain flipping step in ACP utilizing enzyme reactions. To address thislimitation we placed a site-specific fluorescent label on the EsaI AHL synthase conducted enzyme-ACPtitrations in the pre-steady state kinetics regime using a stopped flow fluorometer and determined kon and kofffor both fluorescent and non-fluorescent cargo chain flipping from ACP to the EsaI synthase. Building uponour preliminary data we propose two aims in this application to validate a fluorescence based method fordetermining chain-flipping rate constants in AHL synthase enzymes. Successful completion of the proposedstudies should a) enhance our understanding on the mechanistic basis of substrate recognition in AHLsynthases b) aid in development of a fluorescence-based HTS assay for screening AHL synthase inhibitorsand c) open doors for single molecule enzymological investigations on chain-flipping step in AHL synthesisand d) facilitate deployment of this tool to investigate chain-flipping kinetics over a broader range ofmedicinally important carrier protein dependent enzymes.,12663

The female-to-male ratio is 2:1 with some studies broadening it to 3:1. A similar pattern is observed in experimental disease models although the sex-dependent susceptibility is subjected to the genetic background. Another biological variable that affects the disease establishment and progression is the gut microbiota. Studies from our lab and others showed that the significant reduction or complete absence of gut microbiota reduces the severity and progression of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Reciprocally disease onset alters the gut microbiota composition and increases intestinal permeability suggesting that the gut-microbiota-brain axis acts bidirectionally. While most microbiota studies compare the fecal microbial composition the effects of disease on the microbiota composition of the mucosal layer remain unknown. Exploring this knowledge gap is significant because gut microbes modulate the production and integrity of the gut mucus an extracellular matrix (ECM) and tight junction expression in epithelial cells. Since sex-dependent microbiota differences have been described in EAE mice we hypothesize that disease susceptibility in females and males is directly associated with changes in the microbiota associated with the intestinal mucosal ECM resulting in increased microbial translocation to the lamina propria local and systemic inflammation which subsequently leads to increased neuroinflammation and disease severity. We propose evaluating the effects of the sex-dependent EAE susceptibility in the microbiota composition of the gut lumen and ECM intestinal permeability systemic and CNS inflammation and the effects of microbiota interventions in the intestinal ECM and disease progression. We will use two different EAE models with different sex-dependent susceptibility: the SJL/J EAE model with only female mice being susceptible to the disease and the C57BL/6J model with both females and males susceptible to EAE. We recently showed that the oral treatment with the isoprenoid farnesol a microbial biofilm regulator protected EAE mice against the disease. We now hypothesize that the treatment with farnesol regulates biofilm formation in the microbiota-ECM resulting in increased overall intestinal integrity in sex-dependent EAE susceptible mice. We propose three specific aims to determine whether the disease in sex-dependent EAE susceptible mice promotes a microbiota-ECM architecture that contributes to local systemic and CNS inflammation and whether the oral treatment with farnesol reverses the effects of disease on microbiota and integrity of the gut epithelium and mucosa. The project would extend our understanding of the protective effects of isoprenoids against neuroinflammation by directly targeting MS and studying the gut mucosal layer an extracellular glycoproteinbased matrix.,

We propose that themicrobiota and its impact on systemic and neural GABA metabolism are key contributing factors to the clinicalprogression of MS. Our goal is to determine whether increased intestinal and systemic GABA levels inducedby treatment with a probiotic designed to enhance its synthesis will decrease inflammation by promotingimmunomodulatory T cell responses in a murine model of MS. Furthermore following the undergraduateresearch culture of EWU the interdisciplinary envision of the project will provide an opportunity forundergraduate students from EWU and graduate students from WSU to obtain training in biomedical researchwith particular focus on the gut-brain interactions.,NINDS,10729124,2/9/2023 0:00,PA-21-268,7R15NS107743-02,7,R15,NS,107743,2, ,"UTZ, URSULA",10/20/2022 0:00,3/31/2024 0:00,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-MDCN-R(86)A], ,9370510,"OCHOA-REPARAZ, JAVIER ",Not Applicable,2,BIOLOGY,72995848,HYWTVM5HNFM3,72995848,HYWTVM5HNFM3,US,43.603636,-116.201282,478201,BOISE STATE UNIVERSITY,BOISE,ID,SCHOOLS OF ARTS AND SCIENCES,837250001,UNITED STATES,N,10/20/2022 0:00,3/31/2024 0:00,853,Non-SBIR/STTR,2019,72993, ,NINDS,51952,21041, ,PROJECT SUMMARY Reduced serum levels of the inhibitor neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) are found inpatients suffering from progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) and preliminary evidence suggests that intestinalGABA levels are also reduced when compared to healthy individuals. Intestinal bacteria play a role in GABAand L-Glutamate metabolism. GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter and key regulator of the gastrointestinaltract function and Glu is an excitatory neurotransmitter. Several groups of bacteria including lactic acidbacteria synthesize Glu or harbor the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) that catalyzes the synthesisof GABA. Because of their role modulating GABA/Glutamate levels intestinal microbes can be targeted forGABAergic inhibitory effects. Our preliminary data show that disease alone alters the composition of themicrobiota of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice a model to study MS. Among othersbacteria taxa grouped as lactic acid bacteria that contain species associated with immunomodulatory roleswere reduced in the gut of diseased mice. We propose that the gut microbiota and its impact on systemic andneural GABA metabolism are key contributing factors to the clinical transition to the progression of MS. Wehypothesize that 1) the heightened immune/inflammatory response observed in patients who haveexperienced acute inflammatory MS increases intestinal barrier permeability; 2) this disrupts the composition ofthe microbiome to reduce the number of GABA-producing microbes; 3) Decreases in intestinal and systemicGABA concentrations follow leading to 4) enhanced immune/inflammatory response in the central nervoussystem (CNS) and the gut resulting in additional further imbalances of both microbiota and GABA. In order totest our hypotheses we propose to determine in the experimental EAE disease (C57BL/6 model induced withmyelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein 35-55 MOG35-55) whether GABA supplementation using a geneticallyengineered probiotic designed to express additional copies of GAD (GAD-L. lactis) will decrease inflammationby promoting immunomodulation (Aim 1) reduce intestinal barrier permeability (Aim 2) and ultimately improvedisease progression (Aim 3). We anticipate that targeting GABA levels in EAE will reduce the extent ofintestinal and systemic inflammation intestinal permeability and bacterial translocation and will restore thecomposition of the intestinal microbiota. We predict that the outcome will be the protection against theprogression of the disease associated with enhanced levels of GABA both intestinal and systemically. Ourresearch approach targeting the microbiota has not yet been attempted underscoring the innovation andnovelty of our project that could revolutionize therapeutics for MS. Our approach was designed specifically tooffer undergraduate and graduate students the opportunity to contribute on a neuroimmunology project thatfocuses on the gut/brain axis.,72993

The results of this studywill enhance our understanding of how bone health may be maintained for breast cancersurvivors and those who have undergone chemotherapy. This question is at the foundation ofconcerns for women who have had breast cancer treatment and who are therefore at anincreased risk for osteoporosis and fracture. The risk of developing breast cancer increases withage and is particularly high in women age 60 and older. Because of their age these women arealready at an increased risk for osteoporosis. Case rates in Idaho are higher than the nationalaverage and much higher for some of the more rural counties within Idaho. Prevention andtherapeutic interventions are needed to minimize bone loss and reduce fracture risk in this largeand growing population. The proposed work will leverage resources available at Boise StateUniversity specifically the Biomolecular Research Core and the RNA sequencing laboratory.The objective for this project is to investigate low-intensity vibration-induced improvements inboth DNA damage repair in mesenchymal stem cells osteoblast differentiation andextracellular matrix production during cisplatin treatment. Results from this project will yield agreater understanding of how external mechanical force is involved in maintaining bone healthduring anti-cancer treatment. At the completion of the proposed experiments we anticipate agreater understanding of non-pharmacologic and targeted therapeutic interventions to decreaselong-term sequelae following chemotherapy. The results of the proposed work may reduce bonefractures cancer metastasis and recurrence. Additionally this administrative supplement willexpand the research and research capacity to conduct womens health research in the state ofIdaho.,280294

The SWID B2B program was originally developed using a previous NIH R25funding mechanism and will be entering its second five-year span under the T34 mechanism. Based on statisticsfrom our institutional self-assessments the SWID B2B program has the long-term goal of increasing the numberof individuals from UR groups in Idaho that pursue research careers in the biomedical sciences. The short-termgoals of this T34-funded B2B program are to i) increase the number of UR CWI community college students thattransfer to BSU into biomedical science majors ii) increase retention and graduation rates for UR biomedicalscience transfer students and iii) prepare UR students for careers in the biomedical sciences. In steady statethis program will serve hundreds of students per year and include annual B2B cohorts of 10 UR students. Toaccomplish our goals we request funding for the following five specific aims. Aim 1. Recruit and selectprogram participants. The objective of this aim is to Recruit UR students with strong potential interests infutures that include biomedical research and to Select UR students (in cohorts of 10 per year) into the B2Bprogram. Aim 2. Advise and prepare student trainees. The object of this aim is to Advise CWI students earlyand continuously through program ambassadors and to Prepare students for a research experience by offeringB2B-enhanced courses at CWI and providing peer mentoring. Aim 3. Immerse and include student trainees.The objective of this aim is to Immerse community college students in a biomedical research experience with afaculty mentor during the summer before they transfer to the university campus and to Include students in theeveryday activities associated with biomedical research. Aim 4. Equip and support student trainees. Theobjective of this aim is to Equip students as they move through their degree program at BSU by providing anacademic-year research experience and a professional development course as well as to Support students forsuccess by providing them continued scientific mentorship and the opportunity to present their research datanationally.

We hypothesized that the high cholesterol content and the formation of pure cholesterolbilayer domains decreases the binding of -crystallin to lens membrane which should protect against cataractdevelopment.

CBDs areformed in the fiber-cell plasma membrane of the eye lens and have positive physiological functions helping tomaintain lens transparency and possibly protect against cataract formation. The soluble lens protein -crystallinis a major structural protein that under healthy conditions forms a transparent lattice in the lens and plays amajor role in maintaining lens transparency. Several discoveries report that the level of -crystallin in the lenscytoplasm declines with age and cataract progression accompanied by a corresponding increase in the amountof membrane-bound -crystallin. However the mechanism by which -crystallin associates with fiber-cell plasmamembrane and how the age-related change in membrane lipid composition affects the -crystallin binding isunclear. I hypothesize that the binding of -crystallin to membrane is inhibited by CBDs which decreases thelight scattering and helps maintain lens transparency. In their proposed role CBDs should increase the level of-crystallin in the lens cytoplasm favoring its chaperone function and maintaining lens cytoplasm homeostasis. Idiscovered that the properties of CBDs change significantly with age and are related to the size of the CBDwhich increases with age and is greater in nuclear than in cortical membranes. Based on my extensiveexperience working with CBDs in model and human lens membranes I will (i) determine the lipid composition infiber-cell plasma membranes that promotes or inhibits the binding of -crystallin to membranes (ii) test thehypothesis that CBDs inhibit the binding of -crystallin to membranes and finally (iii) determine the effects ofCBD on the binding of -crystallin in clear and cataractous human lens membranes of different age groups. Theanalysis will include donor's health history sex and race. I developed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)methods to study small-volume aqueous biological samples (3 L at X-band or 150 nL at W-band) particularlyfor studies of lens membranes obtained from the eyes of a single donor. This technique provides a majoradvantage when studying the binding of -crystallin in membranes of age-matched clear and cataractous lensesfrom human donors. In addition the EPR approach has the unique ability to simultaneously provide informationabout the CBDs and the binding of -crystallin. For the last eight years my research has focused onunderstanding the molecular organization of lipids and proteins in plasma membrane of intact fiber cells of humaneye lenses. Building upon the knowledge I acquired during these studies here I propose moving my research ina new direction to focus on the interaction of CBDs with -crystallin. There is a clear need for a more in-depthunderstanding of the roles of CBDs in the binding of -crystallin in the fiber cell plasma membrane. The findingsfrom this study will help fill this gap and produce valuable insights in maintaining lens transparency.,290355

However previous systems were limited due to their static nature  their mechanical properties are fixed. Recently we demonstrated a new silk hydrogel crosslinked with tyramine-substituted silk fibroin that stiffened over time at controllable rates. The programmable stiffness of these hydrogels makes them attractive for modeling the changes in tissue-level stiffness that are associated with musculoskeletal development or following injury. We will modify these hydrogels to incorporate decellularized muscle extracellular matrix (ECM) obtained through a recently established decellularization protocol. Our preliminary data suggest coupling ECM to our silk matrices can be used to further fine-tune the stiffening enabling highly controllable and distinct mechanical and matrix protein gradients within the same gel by spatially varying the amount and type of ECM mixed in with the silk precursors. A silk-ECM hydrogel has not previously been developed. Our central hypothesis is that dynamically stiffening hydrogels with highly tunable mechanical and biochemical characteristics can recapitulate key aspects of the myogenic environment more effectively than existing engineered systems and as a result will improve our understanding of the process to enable better control of the therapeutic potential of myogenically differentiating iPSCs for regenerating skeletal muscle. We will develop hydrogels as novel in vitro systems to explore the impacts of dynamic stiffness on myogenesis of iPSCs. We will test our hypothesis using two specific aims. The first aim will be to determine how evolving stiffness in 3D hydrogels impacts iPSC myogenesis. The second aim will be to develop a biochemically functionalized and mechanically dynamic silk-ECM hydrogel for generation of skeletal muscle from iPSCs. Completion of these aims will enhance our understanding of the regulators of skeletal muscle development and the impact of dynamic substrate stiffness and matrix composition on stem cell differentiation with the ultimate goal of therapeutically targeting these mechanisms to regenerate skeletal muscle using stem cells. 3D hydrogels can be further used to investigate the processes that regulate development aging injury and disease of skeletal muscle.,

The thematic focus of matrix biology has allowed researchers to address some of the mostchallenging health concerns facing our nation. To date this centralized mechanism has supported sixteenjunior investigators seven as Research Project Investigators and nine at the Pilot Investigator level. The centerhas allowed us to capitalize on the broad diverse research base that exists at Boise State University. In PhaseII we propose to enhance and grow the COBRE in Matrix Biology program by building upon the programmaticinfrastructure that was established in Phase I through the Administrative Core. The primary goals of Phase II ofthe COBRE in Matrix Biology are to support investigators to enhance the productivity of junior mid-career andestablished scientists to facilitate collaboration between both junior and established researchers and to buildbiomedical research infrastructure at Boise State University. Major programmatic emphases of the COBRE inMatrix Biology are to support the analysis of animal models of relevance to cell-extracellular matrix interactionsin disease progression and tissue repair/regeneration and to provide access to research instrumentation andtechnical support. Through the Administrative Core the COBRE in Matrix Biology will sponsor careerdevelopment of junior investigators the establishment of new collaborations between investigators activitiesthat will promote the exchange of information ideas and reagents between COBRE members. We will continueto grow the center by recruiting non-members who are doing meritorious research within the thematic focus ofthe COBRE in Matrix Biology. The Administrative Core will continue to offer a pilot project program as arecruitment tool to provide funding to young and to established investigators who propose to apply theirexpertise to matrix biology.,

Since the beginning of Phase I in 2014 wehave vigorously intervened limitations that hinder achieving our goals. Program accomplishments resultingfrom career development and mentoring of junior investigators led to an increase in research grant awardsduring Phase I. We accomplished an increase in access to and use of shared instrumentation within theCOBRE Core facilities. Most importantly a culture shift has occurred at Boise State University. Seveninvestigators received significant new funding and graduated from the COBRE mentoring program. The PilotProject Program contributed to investigator success and served as an onramp for two of our Research ProjectInvestigators working toward R01 grant submission during Phase II. A critical mass of investigators has beenestablished around the thematic focus of matrix biology that includes a diverse cadre from disciplines includingbiology chemistry physics materials science computer science mechanical and biomedical engineering andelectrical engineering. The COBRE program has put Boise State in a position to make significant contributionsto solutions addressing national health concerns. New laboratories have been built and core facilities havebeen established supporting proteomics and metabolomics histology microscopy imaging andbiostatistics/bioinformatics. COBRE investigators published 98 peer-reviewed manuscripts includingnoteworthy articles in journals of high impact. Phase II is critically important for us to continue our upwardmomentum toward our goals of research growth over the next five years. To achieve this overarching goal fourspecific aims are proposed: 1) enhance and grow upon the critical mass of investigators established aroundthe thematic multidisciplinary focus of matrix biology 2) enhance biomedical research core capabilities 3)grow research collaborations with existing programs and 4) enhance research training opportunities. Uponsuccessful completion of the proposed aims we will have strengthened and enhanced the critical mass ofinvestigators with shared priorities in understanding the role of the matrix in development and disease. Sharedcore facilities will be enhanced and will support the needs of more investigators as they follow a mentoredcareer development plan. The multidisciplinary nature that was established in Phase I will continue to grow toinclude additional investigators across our institution.,2107499

Thisstudy will investigate how changes in the composition of the perivascular extracellular matrix a densemeshwork of proteins that immediately surrounds the blood vessels contribute to BBB dysfunction and willfocus primarily on the two small leucine-rich proteoglycans (SLRP) decorin and biglycan which have beenobserved at abnormally high levels in the perivascular matrix of patients with multiple sclerosis. Understandingthe roles of these SLRPs in BBB dysfunction as well as the mechanisms by which they act may allow for thedevelopment of novel therapeutic targets for use in the treatment of a wide variety of CNS diseases.,NINDS,10609845,4/7/2023 0:00,PA-19-056,5R01NS110934-04,5,R01,NS,110934,4, ,"BOSETTI, FRANCESCA",7/1/2020 0:00,4/30/2025 0:00,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-BDCN-E(02)], ,11320048,"BEARD, RICHARD SCOTT",Not Applicable,2,NONE,72995848,HYWTVM5HNFM3,72995848,HYWTVM5HNFM3,US,43.603636,-116.201282,478201,BOISE STATE UNIVERSITY,BOISE,ID,ORGANIZED RESEARCH UNITS,837250001,UNITED STATES,N,5/1/2023 0:00,4/30/2024 0:00,853,Non-SBIR/STTR,2023,330175, ,NINDS,235000,95175, ,PROJECT SUMMARYOver the past decade the importance of the extracellular matrix (ECM) composition surrounding the endothelialcells (ECs) of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) has been increasingly recognized not only in barrier developmentand maintenance but also in dysfunction. The tight junction protein claudin-5 (CLDN5) is critical for sealingparacellular pores between ECs to prevent the passage of fluids solutes and cells thereby forming the defacto BBB. Major gaps in knowledge include what ECM alterations occur during inflammatory injuries and howthey contribute to barrier disruption plus how ECM-EC interactions regulate CLDN5. Our long-term goal is toelucidate the endothelial-specific signaling pathways responsible for BBB dysfunction during inflammation.The overall objective of this proposal is to define the role of ECM-mediated dysregulation of CLDN5-dependentBBB function during inflammation. Emphasis is placed on a novel role for the isoform-specific function of AKT2in maintaining maximal CLDN5 expression during homeostasis plus a proinflammatory role of two small leucine-rich proteoglycans (SLRPs) decorin and biglycan in CLDN5 downregulation during neuroinflammation. Thecentral hypothesis is that inflammation triggers a release of endothelial-derived SLRPs which act in an autocrinefashion to interfere with constitutive ECM-dependent regulation of CLDN5 contributing to BBB dysfunction. Thishypothesis was derived from preliminary findings generated in the applicants laboratory. The rationale for theproposed research is that a better understanding of ECM pathobiology will translate into increased insights ofthe pathogenic role of BBB dysfunction in a multitude of inflammation-associated diseases in the central nervoussystem (CNS) which collectively account for the suffering of approximately 9 million people in the United Statesalone and bear a cost burden of 300 billion dollars annually. Guided by robust preliminary data this hypothesiswill be tested by two specific aims: 1) Determine the role of endothelial-derived SLRPs in BBB dysfunction duringinflammation; and 2) Define the role of impaired 1-ILK-AKT2 signaling in ECM-dependent BBB dysfunction.The approach will be multifaceted combining in vivo physiological analyses in a relevant animal model withcomparable ex vivo and in vitro experiments using primary ECs isolated from CNS tissue. Innovativeexperimental models include transgenic mice with inducible BBB-specific SLRP deficiency or AKT2overexpression; new molecular tools such as Tet-On constructs for gene transfer of decorin biglycan ILKand AKT2; targeted screening of pharmacologic agents; and state-of-the-art histopathology techniques todetect inflammatory-mediated ECM alterations likely to only be present surrounding a small percentage ofCNS microvessels (perivenular inflammatory lesions). The proposed research is significant as data derivedfrom these studies will not only establish novel concepts in ECM-dependent regulation of the endothelium butwill also provide new mechanistic insights into the pathophysiology of BBB dysfunction with the potential toprovide a basis for the development of new therapeutictargets.,330175

Dysregulationof collagen production is a hallmark of pathological fibrosis which can affect any organ that contains collagen(including the liver lung kidney heart skin and intestine). The long-term goal is to understand the mechanismswithin the cell that produce collagen and thereby enable rational design of novel drugs to treat fibrotic diseases.The proposed work will identify how the 5 untranslated region of collagen type I messenger RNA (mRNA)regulates synthesis of the collagen protein through interactions with the RNA-binding protein LARP6. Our centralhypothesis is that LARP6 remodels a critical secondary structural element in this region a bulged stem-loop(termed 5SL) to increase the accessibility of the protein coding sequence start codon to the cellular translationmachinery. Our rationale is that specific and ordered interactions between the 5 untranslated region of thecollagen 1(I) mRNA and LARP6 and are critical to regulation of collagen synthesis. We will test this centralhypothesis through the following specific aims: 1) Determine how structures of the 5SL of collagen 1(I) and2(I) contribute to thermodynamics of LARP6 binding affinity and 2) Define how strand annealing anddissociation kinetics of the collagen 5SL by LARP6 chaperone activity modulates translation. In the first aim wewill use solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to determine the high-resolution structures ofthe collagen 1(I) and 2(I) 5SLs. We will characterize enthalpic and entropic contributions to LARP6 bindingand conduct a molecular thermodynamic analysis of ion effects using isothermal titration calorimetry. In thesecond aim we will characterize how LARP6 affects the RNA strand annealing and dissociation kinetics of thewildtype 5SLs as well as mutants that alter the sequence and structure of the predicted internal bulge. We willalso develop a luciferase-based translation reporter system to characterize effects of mutations and LARP6chaperone activity on translation initiation. The fields understanding of LARP6-mediated collagen type Iexpression has almost exclusively focused on the protein. This proposed project will be significant as it will fill acritical gap in our understanding of the mechanism by identifying how the structure and thermodynamics of theprimary molecular target the 5UTR of collagen mRNAs contributes to protein binding start codon accessibilityand subsequent upregulation of collagen type I production.,52816

AHLsynthases make AHL autoinducer signals by enzymatically coupling acyl-ACP/acyl-CoA and S-adenosyl-L-methionine metabolites to facilitate quorum sensing for the bacterium. Small molecule inhibitors of AHLsynthase enzymes would limit signal synthesis interrupt quorum sensing and thus hold significant promiseas chemical tools to investigate QS networks in bacteria. Designing AHL synthase-specific inhibitors howeverdoes remain a significant challenge. To develop AHL synthase selective inhibitors we recently embarked ona proof-of-concept study to evaluate the potential of AHL signal derivatives as product analog inhibitors ofPseudomonas aeruginosa RhlI AHL synthase. In this study we demonstrated that AHL analogs could serveas chemical probes to uncover novel inhibition and activation binding pockets that could be tapped to developpotent AHL synthase-specific modulators. In this grant application we extend this approach on a broaderscale to evaluate the utility of AHL analog chemical probes in discovering novel binding pockets determiningthe mechanistic basis of AHL synthase modulation and formulating the rules of AHL engagement in shortmedium and long-chain preferring AHL synthases. Additionally we will determine how the inhibition andactivation pockets could be leveraged to develop novel substrates and substrate analog inhibitors of AHLsynthases. Successful completion of these studies should inform the rational design of inhibition and activationpocket directed AHL synthase modulators. Finally the goals described in this application are tightly alignedwith the objectives of AREA program which are to a) support meritorious research at an undergraduatefocused institution b) strengthen the research environment at the home institution and c) provide opportunityfor undergraduate students to get involved in biomedical research. ,408579

Evidence emerging from our preliminary studies shows that these cellularentities are coordinated into a signaling mechanism that has not been previously observed. Theimplications of our observation are broad and likely to have deep impacts on our understandingof cell interactions within cellular microenvironments as well as cellular behaviors in a range ofnormal and pathological scenarios. In this renewal application we investigate the hypothesisthat Notch tyrosine phosphorylation regulates angiogenesis. To address this hypothesis wehave proposed two aims that dig deeper into the molecular regulation of Notch activity throughtyrosine phosphorylation by Src kinase and to understand how Notch tyrosine phosphorylationimpacts angiogenesis and vascular function. Throughout these studies and in the spirit of theAREA program we will engage high school undergraduate and graduate students to buildscientific confidence and teach skills these students will require in order to pursue careers inscience. At the conclusion of our studies we will have accomplished two important milestonestowards understanding this novel regulatory mechanism. Specifically we will have unraveledmany molecular details describing how Src controls Notch and we will have defined theimportance of this signaling cascade to vascular biology. Since both Notch and vascular biologyoperate in a wide variety of normal and disease states our work is highly relevant to thepromotion of human health.,408339

In Eukaryotic cells thisfate is determined by the successful execution of several processes including transcription (initiation elongationand release) splicing nuclear export and degradation. These processes are not independent in space or time.The rate and completion of any one process may influence that of another and kinetic studies conducted onisolated components can be misleading or incomplete. Unfortunately the coordinated kinetics of RNA processingevents remains poorly understood primarily due to a lack of experiments that can either reproduce it in vitro orvisualize it in vivo. The main goal of our research is to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the functioning ofthe living genome. Our main tool is live cell single molecule fluorescence microscopy. By fluorescently labelingprotein and RNA molecules and DNA elements within living cells we can determine the spatiotemporalrelationships between them that govern gene expression and RNA splicing at an active gene in a living cell. Ourmost recent work has measured the timing of gene activation by the transcription factor Glucocorticoid receptorafter binding to dexamethasone and the temporal coordination of transcription[12] and splicing of intron 2 of ahuman beta globin reporter gene[3]. We do this using novel single molecule approaches and cutting edge livecell single molecule fluorescence microscopy. Our methods are based on fluorescence correlation spectroscopywhich utilizes high temporal resolution to characterize changes in fluorescence intensity at a location in spaceand time and relates that to molecular concentrations interactions and dwelltime using physical andcomputational models. Models are tested using Bayesian inference criterion.

These efforts are largelybased on a growing number of studies including our preliminary data that have observed transgenedelivery to cardiac myocytes via intravenous injection of a viral vector. However to date there is noempirically backed rationale for any mechanism underlying this important finding. My lab has focusedon the prospect of endothelial cell transdifferentiation for many years and accrued evidence that thisprocess exists in adult mice and may be responsible for the homeostasis of diverse cell types. Ourpreliminary data coupled with our proposed approach will determine whether cardiac myocyte labelingis the result of a transdifferentiation event (endothelial cell or otherwise) or the product of extracellularvesicle transfer. This work will also confirm whether the source of this labeling is endothelial cells. Weare also interested in determining the nature of intravenous transgene delivery to other cell types whichcould yield information about the localization of endothelial cell transdifferentiation to discrete niches.The existence of such niches could have important implications for enhancing the vascular pathologyof those regions. This work will be undertaken using separate state-of-the-art cell lineage tracingstrategies that encompass virus protein and cell-based methods. The answers provided by this studywill help guide efforts for cardiac genetic therapy advance our understanding of endothelial cell biologyand provide potentially new insights into cardiovascular disease.,408731

Emerging data from our lab suggests that a 151 amino-terminal fragment of apoE4 invitro localizes to the nucleus in neurons and microglia of the human AD brain leading to toxicity andactivation of inflammatory pathways. The present proposal will provide proof-of-concept of thosefindings in vivo by assessing the mechanisms by which this fragment may induce toxicitydevelopmental abnormalities and behavior deficits in a model system consisting of zebrafishembryos and young adult fish.,NIA,10511272,8/12/2022 0:00,PAR-21-155,2R15AG042781-03,2,R15,AG,42781,3, ,"YANG, AUSTIN JYAN-YU",6/1/2013 0:00,7/31/2025 0:00,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-MDCN-R(86)A], ,6692108,"ROHN, TROY T",Not Applicable,2,BIOLOGY,72995848,HYWTVM5HNFM3,72995848,HYWTVM5HNFM3,US,43.603636,-116.201282,478201,BOISE STATE UNIVERSITY,BOISE,ID,SCHOOLS OF ARTS AND SCIENCES,837250001,UNITED STATES,N,8/15/2022 0:00,7/31/2025 0:00,866,Non-SBIR/STTR,2022,393050, ,NIA,289385,103665, ,Alzheimers disease (AD) is a progressive fatal disorder neurodegenerative disease that is the most commoncause of dementia. In addition to advancing age there are known genetic risk factors associated with AD. Ofthe genetic risk factors identified the 34 kDa protein apolipoprotein (Apo) E4 is of significance importance asAPOE4 carriers account for 65-80% of all AD cases. Although ApoE4 plays a normal role in lipoproteintransport how it contributes to AD pathogenesis is currently unknown. Recent data from our lab suggests thatin vitro a 151 amino-terminal fragment of ApoE4 (nApoE41-151) can traffic to the nucleus leading to toxicity andexpression of inflammatory genes in BV2 microglia cells. The goal of this proposal is to expand those findingsin vivo by assessing the mechanisms by which this fragment may induce toxicity developmentalabnormalities and behavior deficits in a model system consisting of zebrafish. Experiments described in Aim 1will rigorously test the hypothesis that nApoE41-151 may increase mortality following exogenous treatment in 48hours post-fertilization (hpf) zebrafish embryos. Parallel experiments will also assess whether trafficking ofnApoE41-151 to the nucleus occurs within the nervous system by fluorescence confocal microscopy. In additionan assessment of developmental abnormalities will be undertaken based on well-defined empirically derivedcriteria. We will determine if nApoE41-151 leads to toxicity or deformation of any other organ system includingthe cardiovascular system. Finally examination for tau pathology following treatment with this fragment couldprovide a link between ApoE4 and a signature molecular pathology found in the human AD brain. Experimentsoutlined in Aim 2 will determine what sublethal effects the nApoE41-151 fragment may have on juvenilezebrafish by examining motor behavior as well as memory integrity. Behavior tests for memory and motorfunctions (assessed by tail flicking and T-maze) will be assessed following treatment of nApoE41-151. Finally inAim 3. we will determine the potential deleterious effects of endogenously generated the nApoE41-151 inzebrafish. In this Aim we propose to generate a new zebrafish strain that expresses nApoE41-151 to determinewhether low-level chronic expression leads to similar developmental and behavioral impairments asexogenous treatment. To accomplish this Aim we will employ a Tol2 transposase method whereby thenApoE41-151 fragment will be expressed. The goal of these experiments will be to generate a permanenttransgenic zebrafish line that can be bred in perpetuity in order to fully study the developmental effects inembryos and young juveniles but also continuing in adult zebrafish if warrantedOverall we are proposing an in vivo model system to extend our in vitro findings and to obtain more robustreliable data that can be extrapolated to an intact organism including humans. Zebrafish are emerging as aneffective in vivo model system to study AD for many reasons including the fact that their neuroanatomic andneurochemical pathways share strong similarities with the human brain. In addition they exhibit a relativelysimple nervous system and optical transparency of embryos permit for easy analyses of organ systems andbrain development. To strengthen our zebrafish studies we will also take advantage of the relative ease toexpress human transgenes in zebrafish to assess in a more physiological milieu the potential long-term effectsof expressing this amino-terminal fragment of ApoE4. Using such a model we hypothesize that the nApoE41-151 fragment will demonstrate significant developmental abnormalities motor dysfunction and memoryimpairments that will further support a novel role of this fragment in the etiology associated with AD.,393050

Over 1200 effective interventions or evidence-based practices (EBPs) have been shown toimprove the well-being of youth with psychiatric disorders. However despite these advances less than half ofyouths treated in community settings experience symptom improvement a situation largely attributed to thelow rates at which community providers adopt EBPs and even when adopted the low fidelity with which EBPsare implemented and sustained. Digital measurement-based care (MBC) systems which collect treatmentoutcome data from patients and provide clinicians with real-time feedback and recommendations based on bigdata actuarial algorithms are a high-impact digital health technology EBP shown in 29 RCTs to generateimprovements in clinical outcomes (i.e. d=.3-.5) across patient ages diagnoses and treatment modalities.Despite this digital MBC systems are rarely used in community settings for youth and when they are fidelityand sustainment are often poor. Recent reviews indicate that many of these implementation and sustainmentdeficits can be traced to a lack of organization-level social infrastructure or social contexts and leadership thatdo not support and motivate clinicians to adopt and use MBC systems; without this organizational socialinfrastructure many implementation efforts fail. These observations are consistent with organizational climatetheory and theories of behavior change which we have integrated to generate our primary hypothesis:achieving effective implementation and sustainment of MBC in community settings requires mechanisms of astrong organizational implementation climate and high clinician motivation generated through effective clinicleadership. With NIH support we have pilot tested a highly transportable implementation strategy calledLeadership and Organizational Change for Implementation (LOCI) that targets these mechanisms. Preliminarystudies in mental health clinics show that LOCI is feasible acceptable and improves implementationleadership and climate. We propose a randomized controlled trial of LOCI in 20 childrens mental health clinicsincorporating 120 clinicians and a total of 720 youth outpatients to test LOCIs effects relative toimplementation as usual (IAU) on clinician fidelity and youth clinical outcomes of a well-established digital MBCintervention during two phases of initial implementation and sustainment. This project brings together an early career/new investigator (Williams) collaborating with experienced NIHfunded implementation scientists (Aarons Ehrhart) to advance programmatic research on the leadershiporganizational and clinician mechanisms that improve digital MBC implementation and sustainment. The studywill (1) test LOCIs effects on clinician fidelity to MBC and youth clinical outcomes during initial implementationand (2) sustainment; and (3) test the multilevel mechanisms that link LOCI to MBC fidelity.,64584

This free software tool was developed to quantify material anisotropy in biological tissue. Materialanisotropy describes the directional dependence of the material structure and the mechanical and chemicalbehavior of biological tissue is regulated by the anisotropy of fibrillar networks. Two essential structuralparameters that mathematically describe the material anisotropy in fibrillar soft tissue are the mean fiberorientation and the distribution of the fiber orientations also called fiber dispersion. The accurate measurementof these parameters is of major importance in understanding structure-function relationships at molecular andmacroscales in biological systems and in the engineering of advanced materials including textileselectrospun scaffolds and fiber reinforced composites. FiberFit is the first and only software application to 1)fully automate the extraction of these parameters 2) evaluate multiple images simultaneously and 3) providevalidation of system accuracy. FiberFit software can be freely downloaded to use on Windows and Macoperating systems.In the parent R15 application Role of Distortion Energy in Fibroblast-Mediated Remodeling of CollagenMatrices FiberFit is used extensively to quantify changes in fibrillar anisotropy when applying variable cyclicloading conditions to three-dimensional cellular scaffolds. The tracked spatiotemporal changes in fibrillaralignment are then used in a growth and remodeling algorithm to describe and predict fibroblast-mediatedremodeling and repair of the extracellular matrix. FiberFit has now been used in five previous publications fromthe PIs lab and has been used outside the PIs lab including the quantification of structural changes intumors liver and muscle and within the cell cytoskeleton. These publications showcase the extremely broaduserbase that FiberFit has the potential to support. The two-dimensional images analyzed by FiberFit can beacquired from numerous imaging modalities including light and fluorescence microscopy SEM TEM SHGand optical cameras. Length scales can vary from molecular to macroscopic and materials can be biologicalinorganic or engineered.Despite the functional advantages and free access of FiberFit the adoption of FiberFit into researchlaboratories has not achieved its potential. One clear barrier to the widespread adoption of FiberFit is theinherent challenges in running and maintaining standalone software on operating systems that evolve anddiscourage non-certified applications (e.g. Mac). This barrier can be eliminated by transitioning FiberFit to thecloud. As a cloud-based application FiberFit could be run on most operating systems and devices andfunctionality could be improved with user accounts that store images and preferences. The objective of thisproject is to re-engineer FiberFit to be a robust intuitive and sustainable cloud-based application.Aim 1: Re-engineer FiberFit to be cloud readyThe python based FiberFit application will be re-engineered and be deployed as a public cloud-basedapplication. Development of this software will follow best design practices for a robust and scalable softwareplatform. A sequential testing framework will be utilized to ensure that the software can be easily adopted bythe end users. This first aim will be completed by a senior software engineer who leads efforts in clouddeployment at Boise State UniversityAim 2: Promote widespread community adoption of FiberFitA successful launch of FiberFit will require supportive documentation and pre-processing features toencourage broad adoption. Documentation will include user manuals video tutorials embedded notificationsand helpful rollover captions. Pre-processing features will allow image cropping and reduction of edge effects.Initial deployment will follow a two-tier strategy of gradually increasing usership. To increase communityawareness a workshop featuring FiberFit will be proposed for the World Congress of Biomechanicsconference. This second aim will be completed by the software engineer a computing student and the PI.We anticipate that this project will take 9-12 months. With a successful launch we believe that FiberFit canimpact thousands of research projects in disparate fields around the world. In the future we envision thatFiberFit will become a suite of automated and validated image processing tools that provide turn-key solutionsto accelerate the pace of discovery in biomedical sciences and material science and engineering.,NIAMS,10452423,9/23/2021 0:00,PA-20-272,3R15AR075314-01S1,3,R15,AR,75314,1,S1,"ZHENG, XINCHENG",9/23/2021 0:00,8/31/2024 0:00, , ,11333982,"LUJAN, TREVOR JUSTIN",Not Applicable,2,ENGINEERING (ALL TYPES),72995848,HYWTVM5HNFM3,72995848,HYWTVM5HNFM3,US,43.603636,-116.201282,478201,BOISE STATE UNIVERSITY,BOISE,ID,BIOMED ENGR/COL ENGR/ENGR STA,837250001,UNITED STATES,N,9/23/2021 0:00,8/31/2024 0:00,846,Non-SBIR/STTR,2021,113546, ,OD,80816,32730, ,PROJECT SUMMARYDense connective tissue is composed of an abundant collagen network that is maintained and repaired byfibroblasts.

In 2021 more than281000 new cases of invasive breast cancer are expected to be diagnosed in the United States. The five-yearsurvival rate is 99% for patients diagnosed with localized disease but drops to 27% for those with distantmetastases underscoring a need for therapeutics that protect against the early stages of metastasis whenintervention could be most beneficial. Relevant to this proposal OSM signaling promotes many metastatic-related events including an epithelial to mesenchymal transition and tumor cell detachment migration andinvasion. Importantly OSM signaling is associated with a poor prognosis for breast cancer patients.Breast cancer patients with high levels of tumor tissue OSM correlated with a significant decrease in survivalcompared to those with low OSM levels. It was also determined that serum concentrations of OSM from bothnon-metastatic and metastatic breast cancer patients was significantly higher than levels in serum from healthyindividuals (3.8-fold and 4.9-fold respectively). For this proposal preliminary experiments used a highthroughput computational screen of ~1.65 million compounds for binding to OSM. Those compounds with thebest predicted binding properties were tested for in vitro inhibition of OSM signaling. Two SMIs were identifiedas lead compounds for this proposal. The central hypothesis guiding the proposed experiments is thatstructural optimization based on lead SMIs facilitated by knowledge of important binding interactionswill result in enhanced inhibition of OSM signaling. To test the hypothesis two specific aims are proposed:1) Design and synthesize a focused library of small molecule inhibitors of OSM based on the SMI-10 and SMI-26 scaffolds and 2) Identify optimal lead SMIs that suppress OSM signaling in cells and display minimal cellulartoxicity. In Aim 1 the NMR solution structure of an SMI/OSM complex will be solved and then combined withcomputational modeling to develop a structure-activity model that will be used to design and synthesize newSMIs. In Aim 2 SMIs will be prioritized based on high binding affinity high in vitro inhibition of OSM-mediatedsignaling pathways in several breast cancer cell lines and low cellular toxicity. The end goal of the project is toidentify new compounds with nanomolar binding affinity to OSM and improved inhibitory activity. The proposedresearch will assist in fulfilling the critical need to develop novel treatments for metastatic breast canceroftendescribed as an incurable disease. Since OSM has been linked to other cancers and inflammatory-relateddiseases (e.g. sepsis rheumatoid arthritis and cystic fibrosis) this research lays the groundwork for a new classof anti-inflammatory drugs.,395436

The project will improve youthbehavioral health by advancing the integration of high-impact digital health technologies into routine publicly-funded behavioral health systems.,NIMH,10405594,4/29/2022 0:00,PAR-18-007,5R01MH119127-04,5,R01,MH,119127,4, ,"ACRI, MARY CATHERINE",6/1/2019 0:00,4/30/2024 0:00,Dissemination and Implementation Research in Health Study Section[DIRH], ,11307699,"WILLIAMS, NATHANIEL J.",Not Applicable,2,SOCIAL SCIENCES,72995848,HYWTVM5HNFM3,72995848,HYWTVM5HNFM3,US,43.603636,-116.201282,478201,BOISE STATE UNIVERSITY,BOISE,ID,SCHOOLS OF SOCIAL WELFARE/WORK,837250001,UNITED STATES,N,5/1/2022 0:00,4/30/2024 0:00,242,Non-SBIR/STTR,2022,488269, ,NIMH,406155,82114, ,PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Psychiatric disorders are the leading cause of mortality and disability among youth in high incomecountries accounting for 21% of total disease burden and afflicting 1 in 10 youths in the US with severeimpairment. Over 1200 effective interventions or evidence-based practices (EBPs) have been shown toimprove the well-being of youth with psychiatric disorders. However despite these advances less than half ofyouths treated in community settings experience symptom improvement a situation largely attributed to thelow rates at which community providers adopt EBPs and even when adopted the low fidelity with which EBPsare implemented and sustained. Digital measurement-based care (MBC) systems which collect treatmentoutcome data from patients and provide clinicians with real-time feedback and recommendations based on bigdata actuarial algorithms are a high-impact digital health technology EBP shown in 29 RCTs to generateimprovements in clinical outcomes (i.e. d=.3-.5) across patient ages diagnoses and treatment modalities.Despite this digital MBC systems are rarely used in community settings for youth and when they are fidelityand sustainment are often poor. Recent reviews indicate that many of these implementation and sustainmentdeficits can be traced to a lack of organization-level social infrastructure or social contexts and leadership thatdo not support and motivate clinicians to adopt and use MBC systems; without this organizational socialinfrastructure many implementation efforts fail. These observations are consistent with organizational climatetheory and theories of behavior change which we have integrated to generate our primary hypothesis:achieving effective implementation and sustainment of MBC in community settings requires mechanisms of astrong organizational implementation climate and high clinician motivation generated through effective clinicleadership. With NIH support we have pilot tested a highly transportable implementation strategy calledLeadership and Organizational Change for Implementation (LOCI) that targets these mechanisms. Preliminarystudies in mental health clinics show that LOCI is feasible acceptable and improves implementationleadership and climate. We propose a randomized controlled trial of LOCI in 20 childrens mental health clinicsincorporating 120 clinicians and a total of 720 youth outpatients to test LOCIs effects relative toimplementation as usual (IAU) on clinician fidelity and youth clinical outcomes of a well-established digital MBCintervention during two phases of initial implementation and sustainment. This project brings together an early career/new investigator (Williams) collaborating with experienced NIHfunded implementation scientists (Aarons Ehrhart) to advance programmatic research on the leadershiporganizational and clinician mechanisms that improve digital MBC implementation and sustainment. The studywill (1) test LOCIs effects on clinician fidelity to MBC and youth clinical outcomes during initial implementationand (2) sustainment; and (3) test the multilevel mechanisms that link LOCI to MBC fidelity.,488269

Based on statistics from our institutional self-assessments the SWID B2B program will be established with the long-term goal of increasing the number ofindividuals from underrepresented groups in Idaho that pursue research careers in the biomedical sciences.The short-term goals of this B2B program are to i) increase the number of UR CWI community college studentsthat transfer to Boise State into biomedical science majors ii) increase retention and graduation rates for URbiomedical science transfer students and iii) prepare UR students for careers in the biomedical sciences. Insteady state this program will serve hundreds of students per year and include yearly B2B cohorts of 10 URstudents. To accomplish our goals we request funding for the following three specific aims. Aim 1. Preparestudents for a biomedical research experience. The objective of this aim is to Recruit UR students into theB2B program Prepare students for a research experience by offering four courses at CWI relevant tobiomedical sciences and Mentor and Advise students early and continuously. Aim 2. Engage students in abiomedical research experience. The objective of this aim is to Immerse community college students in abiomedical research experience with a faculty mentor/researcher during the summer before they transfer to theuniversity campus and to Include students in the everyday activities associated with biomedical research andin the ongoing Boise State Summer Research Community. Aim 3. Provide continued engagement throughcontinuity. The objective of this aim is to Continually Engage students as they move through their degreeprogram at Boise State by providing an academic-year research experience and a professional developmentcourse that includes training for RCR and peer mentoring as well as to Equip students for success aftergraduation by providing a senior level seminar course and the opportunity to present their research datanationally. As studies have demonstrated that undergraduate research experiences like the Bridges programhave an important positive impact on UR groups we expect that an enduring SWID B2B program willtransform the lives of UR students and improve their success as they move forward into biomedical careers.,322624

The hallmark of fibrosis is the accumulation of extracellular collagen which our work aims toaddress by studying the cellular mechanisms of collagen synthesis. This project will enhance our collectiveunderstanding of how to better treat fibrosis while providing opportunities for undergraduate students to gainhands-on experience in biomedical research.,NIGMS,10202324,4/27/2021 0:00,PAR-18-714,1R15GM141770-01,1,R15,GM,141770,1, ,"VATAKIS, DIMITRIOS NIKOLAOS",5/1/2021 0:00,4/30/2024 0:00,Macromolecular Structure and Function C Study Section[MSFC], ,12530898,"BAGGS, ERIC ",Not Applicable,2,CHEMISTRY,72995848,HYWTVM5HNFM3,72995848,HYWTVM5HNFM3,US,43.603636,-116.201282,478201,BOISE STATE UNIVERSITY,BOISE,ID,SCHOOLS OF ARTS AND SCIENCES,837250001,UNITED STATES,N,5/1/2021 0:00,4/30/2024 0:00,859,Non-SBIR/STTR,2021,402174, ,NIGMS,299999,102175, ,Project SummaryCollagen synthesis and homeostasis are integral to the proper function and repair of all tissues. Dysregulationof collagen production is a hallmark of pathological fibrosis which can affect any organ that contains collagen(including the liver lung kidney heart skin and intestine). The long-term goal is to understand themechanisms of translation regulation within the cell that produce collagen and thereby enable rational designof novel drugs to treat fibrotic diseases. The proposed work will identify how the 5 untranslated region ofcollagen type I messenger RNA (mRNA) regulates synthesis of the collagen protein through interactions withthe RNA-binding protein LARP6. Our central hypothesis is that LARP6 remodels a critical secondary structuralelement in this region a bulged stem-loop (termed 5SL) to increase the accessibility of the protein codingsequence start codon to the cellular translation machinery. Our rationale is that specific and orderedinteractions between the 5 untranslated region of the collagen a1(I) mRNA and LARP6 and are critical toregulation of collagen synthesis. We will test this central hypothesis through the following specific aims: 1)determine how structures of the 5SL of collagen a1(I) and a2(I) contribute to thermodynamics of LARP6binding affinity and 2) define how strand annealing and dissociation kinetics of the collagen 5SL by LARP6chaperone activity modulates translation. In the first aim we will determine the high-resolution structures of thecollagen a1(I) and a2(I) 5SLs characterize enthalpic and entropic contributions to LARP6 binding anddetermine the electrostatic and non-electrostatic contributions to binding energy. In the second aim we willcharacterize how LARP6 affects RNA strand annealing and dissociation kinetics of the wildtype 5SLs as wellas mutants that alter the sequence and predicted structure of the internal bulge. The current understanding ofLARP6-mediated collagen type I expression has almost exclusively focused on the protein. This proposedproject will be significant as it will fill a critical gap in our understanding of the mechanism by identifying howthe structure and thermodynamics of the primary molecular target the 5UTR of collagen mRNAs contributesto protein binding start codon accessibility and subsequent regulation of collagen type I protein expression.Finally the goals described in this application are tightly aligned with the objectives of the AREA programwhich are to 1) support meritorious research at an undergraduate focused institution 2) strengthen theresearch environment at the home institution and 3) provide opportunities for undergraduate students to beengaged in biomedical research.,402174

This increases hospital labor costs for staff to constantly clean surfaces withdisinfectants to slow the spread of disease. Infectious hosts can shed SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens that deposit onsolid surfaces and transmit disease to new hosts. This persistent transmission is exemplified by Coronaviruses as they canpersist on surfaces for hours or days and remain infectious through casual physical contact. Among bacterial pathogensmethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Clostridium difficile (CDif and many others) are known to spreadthrough contact with surfaces contaminated by cells or spores shed from infected hosts. While physical or chemical surfacetreatments such as topical antiseptics and air-filtration can mitigate transmission these treatments are not always practicalor compatible with the physical or chemical makeup of the treated surface. These treatments also consume vast quantitiesof gloves wipes disinfectant chemicals and time. An approach that reduces material consumption while still compatiblewith use around people is required for hospitals and other clinical settings. Cold atmospheric-pressure plasma (CAP) hasbeen studied for its ability to inactivate bacterial pathogens on surfaces but seldom examined for anti-viral effects. Furthera clear implementation path for the treatment of large surface areas found in medical facilities has yet to be established. Thisproposed research provides an engineering driven approach to transition CAP systems from laboratory settings to morerealistic applications in medical environments. The approach is supported by Specific Aim 1: Construct CAP-Arrays thatdemonstrate rapid inactivation of Coronavirus and other microbial pathogen surface contaminants and by SpecificAim 2: Fully integrate a CAP-Array into a robotic system and demonstrate rapid inactivation of Coronavirus andother pathogens over large areas and varieties of surfaces. This project will develop a large CAP-Array (10 cm x 10 cm)deployed on a semiautonomous robotic system to enable rapid cost-effective plasma treatment of large surface areaswithout the need for chemicals and with little risk to personnel. The CAP-Array will be tested on a variety of real-worldrelevant surfaces such as linoleum tile painted drywall and formica tabletops for its ability to inactivate viruses such ashuman and animal Coronaviruses (H229E MHV) that provide good models for activity against SARS-CoV-2 and againstrepresentative bacterial pathogens such as MRSA. The objectives of this proposal are to (1) demonstrate that CAP-Array treatment can cause a 3-log reduction in pathogen viability in <5 s over a 100 cm2 area without scanning andthen (2) demonstrate that the CAP-Array-Robot system can be deployed to treat a 2500 cm2 surface in <125 s andcause a 3-log reduction in pathogen viability. A workforce of engineering and biological science graduate andundergraduate students will develop and test the CAP-Arrays prepare viral and bacterial pathogen samples and measurepathogen viability after plasma treatment. The success of this project will lead to a new paradigm for robotic sanitizingequipment useful in decontaminating surfaces in healthcare and other settings.,530650

This is in part due to a critical lack of therapeutics specificallytargeting triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) which is estrogen receptor-negative (ER-) progesterone receptor-negative (PR-) and HER2-negative (HER2-). This negative receptor status eliminates many therapeutic optionsthat exist for ER+ PR+ HER2+ patients. Our long-term goal is to provide preventative and therapeutic treatmentoptions for patients with metastatic breast cancer by identifying novel targeted interventions against theOSM/OSM receptor (OSMR) axis. The goal of this proposal determine how ER status contributes to OSM-induced IL-6 and OSM-promoted breast tumor invasion and metastasis. OSM is an interleukin-6 (IL-6) familycytokine important in inflammation which is produced by activated T-cells monocytes/macrophagesneutrophils and human breast cancer cells. Our published data demonstrates that OSM induces osteolytic bonemetastases in vivo implicating OSM as an important factor in the localized bone metastatic microenvironment.Published data from our lab and others show that OSM promotes an epithelial-mesenchymal transition tumorcell detachment and an invasive phenotype in vitro suggesting that this cytokine may be a critical factor drivingbreast cancer invasion and tumor cell dissemination. We have recently shown that OSM increases circulatingtumor cell (CTC) numbers and metastases to lung in vivo consistent with a more general role for OSM inmetastasis. For this proposal we hypothesize that OSM-induced IL-6 expression is dependent on anegative estrogen receptor alpha (ER) status and that the presence of ER will decrease OSM-drivenbreast cancer metastasis. To test our hypothesis we propose two specific aims: 1) Determine the mechanismsby which ER represses OSM-induced IL-6 expression and 2) Analyze OSM and OSM-induced IL-6 andmetastatic potential in ER+ and ER- breast cancer models.

Given the impact of these injuries on workplace productivity and quality oflife there is a pressing need to help scientists and clinicians improve treatment options by identifying specifictissue deformations that stimulate the repair and regeneration of connective tissue.,NIAMS,9732282,8/13/2019 0:00,PA-18-504,1R15AR075314-01,1,R15,AR,75314,1, ,"ZHENG, XINCHENG",9/1/2019 0:00,8/31/2024 0:00,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-MOSS-D(82)A], ,11333982,"LUJAN, TREVOR JUSTIN",Not Applicable,2,ENGINEERING (ALL TYPES),72995848,HYWTVM5HNFM3,72995848,HYWTVM5HNFM3,US,43.603636,-116.201282,478201,BOISE STATE UNIVERSITY,BOISE,ID,BIOMED ENGR/COL ENGR/ENGR STA,837250001,UNITED STATES,N,9/1/2019 0:00,8/31/2024 0:00,846,Non-SBIR/STTR,2019,393704, ,NIAMS,56162,17542, ,PROJECT ABSTRACTDense connective tissue is composed of an abundant collagen network that is maintained and repaired byfibroblasts. These fibrous tissues are commonly injured and due to poor vascularity are slow to heal leading toover 15 million hospital visits in the U.S. each year. It's well established that dynamic mechanical stimulus willtrigger fibroblasts to repair and remodel the collagen network but the specific states of three-dimensionalmatrix deformation that regulate fibroblast biosynthesis have not yet been identified. One potential explanationis that fibroblast-mediated collagen remodeling is governed at the tissue-scale by distortion strain energy whichaccounts for a change in matrix shape while preserving matrix volume. To test this central hypothesis a novelbioreactor has been developed to administer a unique combination of biaxial stresses that have previously neverbeen applied to 3D fibroblast-seeded scaffolds. This bioreactor will be used to apply varying magnitudes ofdistortion energy to collagen matrices seeded with human fibroblasts for 8 days of culture. Alterations in thecomposition organization and mechanical behavior of the scaffolds will be measured. Kinematic data from theexperiment will be input into a finite element model that uses matrix distortion to modulate collagen growth.Experimental and computational results will be compared for model validation. If successful this study willprovide a mechanistic basis for the repair and regeneration of dense connective tissue and will establish a newexperimental and theoretical framework to study mechanosensitive cells.,73704
