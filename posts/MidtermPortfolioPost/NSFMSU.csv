Over its one-year duration, this collaborative project will develop a collaborative network, plan, and build the infrastructure that will form the basis for a Track-3 S-STEM proposal to fund scholarships for full-time students pursuing graduate degrees in engineering and physical, mathematical, biological, environmental, and psychological sciences across Montana. In partnership with the Montana High Tech Business Alliance and other state-wide employer organizations, new master's students will receive scholarships for the first three semesters of their studies in addition to employment in growing sectors of the state?s STEM industry. Students will be employed full-time in the summer and part-time during the academic year. Student focus groups, meetings with business leaders, and listening sessions with tribal communities will develop shared understandings of strengths and challenges that low-income students face, enhance relationships, and ultimately inform a plan design grounded in reciprocal benefits between low-income students (including indigenous students), rural and reservation communities, and regional economies.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to increase STEM degree completion of low-income, high-achieving graduates with demonstrated financial need. Low-income students face many barriers to graduate education, including insufficient finances, concerns about student debt, pressure to work full-time, and limited knowledge of the ?hidden curriculum? of graduate school. Students in rural regions far from educational or industry hubs may be further reluctant to move away from their families and communities to pursue STEM higher education and careers. This loss of talent adversely impacts STEM industries due to the considerable strengths that low-income, high-achieving students could otherwise bring to these sectors. To fill this gap, this project will explore how innovative partnerships between private high-tech industry and master?s-level STEM degree programs can simultaneously help low-income students in rural contexts achieve their full potential and meet critical workforce needs. By engaging institutions across the state, students may need to move only short distances between their undergraduate and graduate schools and can remain close to their communities while benefitting from financial resources, social capital, and help navigating complex institutional processes. This project is funded by NSF?s Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields. It also aims to improve the education of future STEM workers, and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Montana is the ancestral and modern-day home of many different Indigenous Peoples, yet American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) students comprise only 2% of STEM doctoral students at MSU. Broadly across the nation, only 105 AI/AN students completed a research doctorate across all fields in 2020/21. As a new Bridge to Doctorate site within the All Nations Alliance for Minority Participation, MSU will work towards full participation of underrepresented minorities in STEM as well as support Indigenous self-determination and well-being by providing significant financial support to AI/AN doctoral students and implementing: 1) evidence-based recruitment and retention practices; 2) mentorship and professional development opportunities adapted to Indigenous cultures, values, and experiences; and 3) an innovative support system that enables students to readily rejoin their degree programs if temporarily called away to meet pressing family and community obligations. <br/><br/>In addition to empirically evaluating the efficacy of MSU?s novel Return to Learn model, this project will support participatory and co-produced STEM graduate research projects that prepare AI/AN students for 21st-century STEM careers while ensuring reciprocal benefits with Tribal community partners. Research projects will integrate Indigenous research methodologies and value systems (Relationship, Responsibility, Reciprocity, and Redistribution) with scientific and technological questions pertaining to national priorities ranging from large-scale manufacturing of 2-D materials for quantum computing, to advanced energy storage and conversion technologies, to biofilm engineering, and infectious vector-borne diseases in collaboration with NIH?s Rocky Mountain Lab. Planned professional development workshops will then include Navigating Academia Professionally and Personally, Taking Charge of Your Professional Trajectory, Indigenous Well-being, Creating and Leveraging Colleague Network Groups, and Lessons Learned from AI/AN Alumni. This project will serve as a national model for AI/AN students to carve their own flexible, culturally-responsive STEM doctoral education and career paths that integrate cutting-edge research and scholarship with Indigenous leadership and identity. Results will be disseminated to our university partners in the Sloan Indigenous Graduate Programs and The University Centers for Exemplary Mentoring. We will also present findings at conferences that specialize in AI/AN education.

This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants. The three-year project, Montana Models: Connecting Local and Disciplinary Practices through University-Community Partnerships, focuses on creating, implementing, and studying several learning outcomes associated with youth engagement in mathematical modeling contexts. The project builds on existing partnerships between the state's two research universities and Montana 4-H to target outreach to rural youth and bring them into a network of people who can inspire, support, and sustain STEM learning. Middle school and high school students from rural communities will be invited to a university campus for a residential modeling-based summer program l focused on mathematics and mathematical modeling. Activities at the summer program are designed to engage them in problems relevant to their own backgrounds and experiences and to honor their local funds of knowledge. <br/><br/>The primary goal of Montana Models is to use mathematical modeling as a mechanism for bringing everyday mathematical practices already present in rural communities into contact with disciplinary practices. The project focuses on the following research questions: (1) What are the everyday mathematical practices in Montana communities? (2) How can everyday mathematical practices be leveraged and brought into contact with disciplinary practices in service of mathematizing meaningful questions within the community? (3) How do youth identify and get identified with respect to mathematics and with respect to their role in the world? (4) How does participation in project activities affect participants' knowledge of mathematical practices and content? The project uses social design experimentation, a hybrid research methodology which combines the traditions of design-based research with forms of inquiry that involve collaboration among participants, researchers, and other stakeholders, such as critical ethnography. Data sources include field notes from ethnographic observations, interviews, videos of students engaging in modeling activities, artifacts that show their  mathematical work, and results from the Attitudes Towards Mathematics Inventory. Through its collaboration with 4-H, Montana Models targets outreach to rural youth across the state, especially those from groups that are typically underrepresented in STEM fields. The project is poised to impact ways in which formal and informal educators understand the knowledge bases that are already present in rural communities and how those bases may inform, support, and sustain STEM learning. Findings and deliverables will be disseminated through a public-facing website and through the 4-H infrastructure. This infrastructure includes Montana 4-H's Clover Communication Contest that will allow participating youth to showcase their projects. Research findings will be shared through local and national conferences and peer-reviewed publications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To answer these questions, IMERSS will develop a new generation of smart optical sensors that couple emerging engineering technologies with advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). IMERSS will then deploy the new instruments to measure prescribed fire behavior in real time, acquiring spatially accurate, real-time data about fuels, smoke aerosol type, smoke plume height, smoke trajectory, and social acceptance of prescribed fire and smoke. The acquisition of this data will allow managers of prescribed fires to make better-informed decisions about when and where to burn, and for how long.  These decisions can be shared with individuals and Montana?s community leaders to minimize the adverse effects of prescribed fire.  Thus, IMERSS will produce scientifically grounded strategies for selecting the locations and the timing of prescribed fire events to maximize their benefits and mitigate wildfire and smoke risk.  In doing so, IMERSS will build capacity in Montana by forging ties between researchers in environmental science, remote sensing, optical engineering, AI and ML, and social science.  Four new faculty hires are planned in the first two years of the project, all in AI and ML. The core research program is well integrated with education, workforce development, and diversity plans that span academic, Tribal, public, and private sectors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The MEERC RET Site will focus on improving teachers? self-efficacy for engineering education through an immersive six-week experience combining hands-on energy research within engineering faculty laboratories with customized field trips to energy industry facilities and co-located cultural venues and structured curriculum development activities.  Elementary teacher participants will work directly with engineering and education faculty, research staff and students on energy topics ranging from building energy systems and biomass energy to sustainable transportation infrastructure and innovative materials batteries, wind turbines and solar cells.  The MEERC RET Site will also convene a diverse industry advisory board (IAB) comprised of regional energy industry representatives to share their career experiences and facilitate customized tours of industry-scale energy facilities including a conventional power plant, a petroleum refinery, a wind turbine farm, a cement plant, a hydroelectric dam, and a community-scale solar power plant.  Additionally, the Site IAB will work directly with the participating elementary teachers to help them develop and implement energy-engineering curricula, including facilitating engaging in-class demonstrations and visits (virtual or actual) to nearby industrial facilities.  Through customized, expert-guided and reflective tours of cultural venues and curriculum development activities, the MEERC RET Site Project Team will also work with teachers on essential understandings from Montana?s Constitutional Article, Indian Education for All, which aims to recognize and preserve the distinct and unique cultural heritages of American Indians.  Throughout the academic year, the Site Project Team will help the elementary teachers develop, integrate, and assess culturally responsive energy curricula within their rural/reservation classrooms.  Hundreds of rural and reservation elementary students will be directly impacted by the year-round development, integration and assessment of culturally responsive engineering education modules within their elementary science curricula via this interdisciplinary project.  Structured two-way knowledge exchanges highlighting elementary teachers? perspectives and assets will help create a collegial and collaborative ecosystem among academia, industry, and elementary teachers aimed at promoting more inclusive STEM identity formation opportunities, and ultimately a more diverse STEM workforce.       <br/><br/>Three overarching goals of the new Montana Engineering Education Research Center (MEERC) RET Site are to (1) promote inclusive engineering identity formation among diverse rural and reservation students by (2) increasing elementary teacher self-efficacy in culturally responsive engineering education via (3) establishing a collaborative ecosystem among regional elementary schools, industry and academia focused on energy research and diversifying the future engineering workforce.  To achieve these goals, the three-year MEERC RET Site Project will facilitate an engaging, holistic and integrated six-week summer experience for at least thirty elementary teachers, which (1) provides authentic energy-related research experiences within engineering laboratories and with appropriate scaffolding and connections to elementary settings, coupled with (2) customized, guided and reflective tours of Montana energy industry facilities and nearby cultural venues, all while (3) fostering development, integration and sharing of unique and high-impact energy-related engineering curricula in diverse elementary classrooms.  Motivated by the efficacy of early STEM identify formation in students pursuing STEM careers and leveraging both existing partnerships and diverse energy-related research, pre- and in-service elementary teachers (grades 3-5) will be recruited from Montana?s rural and reservation communities to participate in the MEERC RET Site at Montana State University (MSU) in Bozeman.  Following structured orientations, trainings and two-way knowledge exchange opportunities, Site participants will engage in hands-on energy-related research experiences, working with engineering faculty and students and contributing directly to funded research projects such as building energy systems, biomass energy conversions, fluid flow processes, materials for energy conversion technologies, and sustainable transportation systems.  Site participants will tour regional energy-related industrial facilities, including a conventional electric power plant, an oil refinery, a hydroelectric dam, a wind farm, a cement plant, and solar power projects.  These site visits will be facilitated by MSU engineering alumni, who will comprise an Industry Advisory Board (IAB) for the Site, which will also engage directly with teachers and classrooms.  A unique and integral feature of the MEERC RET Site will be customized, expert-guided and research-informed tours of regionally co-located venues with local Indigenous cultural significance, including a buffalo jump, pictograph caves, various museums, and monuments.  Participants will also engage in research-informed activities to help build cultural awareness and incorporate indigenous wisdom and engineering practices, such as tipi raising, hide tanning and food preparation - as they relate to energy.

Numbering in the thousands, 2D materials offer an expansive library of potential systems for next-generation quantum information science technologies. The exploration of these materials presents significant opportunities to grow the quantum industry in the US, but the vast parameter space presents several formidable challenges that slow the pace of scientific discovery and translating discoveries into quantum technologies. The MonArk Quantum Foundry directly addresses these challenges by (1) the development of materials synthesis and fabrication tools tailored to rapidly assemble prototype quantum devices made from two-dimensional materials, (2) the seamless integration of these tools with next-generation quantum-relevant characterization instrumentation, (3) making this newly developed infrastructure openly accessible to academic, government, and industrial research groups, and (4) providing open-source inspired infrastructure to accelerate the exchange of samples, ideas, technical knowledge, and pedagogical resources to quantum researchers and educators across the US. In addition to impacting the broader community, the MonArk Quantum Foundry accelerates collaborative research priorities of teams from Montana State University and the University of Arkansas to leverage two-dimensional quantum materials for generating and manipulating quantum states of light, innovating new qubit architectures, and exploring quantum magnetic phenomena in two-dimensions. Industrial partnerships and close synergy between theoretical and experimental research are deeply integrated at all levels of Foundry activities.

Two ?2D Quantum Materials Pipelines? will be developed and hosted at the Foundry sites at Montana State University and the University Arkansas that integrate robotic automation of the most cumbersome and time-consuming processes of 2D quantum research with cutting-edge quantum characterization instrumentation developed in close collaboration with industrial partners for maximally effective quantum research. The 2D Quantum Materials Pipelines leverage technological innovations to enable researchers to rapidly progress from the conception of a new 2D system to a quantum device to be tested and characterized, accelerating all aspects of translational science in this field. The capabilities of the 2D Quantum Materials Pipelines as well as the acquired technical knowledge and scientific discoveries are made available to researchers through collaborations and open-source resources that expand the reach of the Foundry activities and infrastructure across the US. The in-house research activities of the Foundry converge experimental and theoretical expertise, new concepts from big data and machine learning, and industrial guidance. The 2D Quantum Materials Pipelines enable exploration of novel quantum systems and phenomena such as 2D quantum magnetism and ferroelectricity and development of quantum technologies such as single-photon emitters, entangled photon-pair sources, and novel qubits. Education and outreach activities include websites, webinars, short courses, public engagements, in-person laboratory training for middle/high school/undergraduate/graduate students, and continued professional development for technical workers from industry. The Foundry develops a quantum-literate workforce by integrated research and learning and builds leadership in the quantum sciences by advancing early-career faculty into leadership positions, the impact of which will endure for decades.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by Condensed Matter Physics Program, Division of Materials Research, and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In classical computing, information is encoded and processed in bits that can exist in one of two states, typically depicted as 0 or 1, and each bit acts independently.  Quantum bits (qubits) behave fundamentally different and can be placed in a superposition state, representing a combination of all possible configurations of the qubit. This can potentially solve complex problems beyond our current computing capability. Additionally, quantum systems can be entangled, which links the behavior of two separate items. This can increase quantum computing capability and provide unbreakable encryption in quantum communication. QISE has the potential to revolutionize all information science areas, and leadership in this field represents a huge economic opportunity. The region of service for this Development Award includes the states of Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming, which contain one of only two NSF-funded Quantum Foundries nationally, multiple existing quantum research groups, and multiple companies that are part of the Quantum Supply Chain producing not only quantum materials but also other photonic, electronic, cryogenic and classical computing components required to stabilize, encode and decode, transmit or interface with quantum computers and information systems. <br/><br/>University-led use-inspired research will include investigating quantum devices by Boise State University's Quantum DNA group, new methods of designing and fabricating topological Josephson junction qubits by the University of Wyoming, two-dimensional quantum materials, and quantum networking by Montana State University. Much of this work will collaborate with Montana Instruments, Teledyne FLIR, Cylynt, Quantel, AdvR, Wavelength Electronics, Micron, and Qubitekk. Collaborative research, with private sector input into performance requirements and vested interest in the outcomes, will improve the probability of translation of that research. The envisioned Engine team will comprise educational institutions at the university, community college, and Tribal college levels, incubator and accelerator entities, business alliances, economic development organizations, non-profits, and state and local government economic development-related offices. The team has a coalition of members with track records of success in accelerating advances in emerging technologies and industries, taking innovations to commercialization, supporting and creating start-ups and small businesses, workforce development, and catalyzing local and regional economic development.

A powerful way to study microbes is to characterize their biology under natural conditions at single-cell resolution and link their in situ phenotype - their function in their natural habitat - and genotype - their genetic make-up. While promising, the available instrumentation capable of achieving such phenotype-based cell characterization is notoriously low throughout, destructive to the cell, or both. This project will overcome these bottlenecks by combining stimulated Raman spectroscopy-based cell characterization, microfluidics-based cell sorting, and downstream genetic characterization of sorted cells.

The first step will be to conduct baseline surveys of students and faculty to obtain information needed to prioritize and design educational interventions. Project components will include: 1) activities to reduce stigma; 2) facilitated psychoeducational peer mentoring to assist students in developing effective coping strategies and enhanced resilience; 3) STEM faculty workshops aimed at implementing holistic mentoring, enhancing inclusiveness, and transforming departmental climates; and 4) activities engaging advisors and advisees together in collaborative problem solving. After refining the approach and demonstrating effectiveness on the three campuses, the team will assist three other universities in adapting the approaches to demonstrate scale up.

In birds, spine fusion is more extensive, with approximately half of the vertebrae are fused into compound bony structures. Increased fusion in birds arose during evolution as an adaptation for flight. The biological mechanisms responsible for normal vertebral fusion are largely unknown. However, using the chicken as a model organism, the PI made the surprising discovery that sterile inflammation drives fusion in the tail. Inflammation is generally a response to disease or trauma, but here the PI uncovered a novel role for sterile inflammation in normal bone development. The PI inhibited inflammation with corticosteroids, and found that this treatment inhibits tail fusion, demonstrating a previously unknown effect of corticosteroids on spine maturation. The implications for these findings are vast, not just for avian evolution but for axial development across vertebrates, and for the possible side effects of corticosteroid treatment in humans. For this project, the PI will determine whether inflammation is a common driver of normal vertebral fusion, or whether multiple mechanisms have evolved for this process. Additionally, as part of a long-standing collaboration, the PI will link the genomics capabilities of Montana State University and Clemson University.<br/><br/>This Research Infrastructure Improvement Track-4 EPSCoR Research Fellows (RII Track-4:NSF) project would provide a fellowship to an Assistant Research Professor at Montana State University (MSU). This work would be conducted in collaboration with researchers at Clemson University. The goals of this proposal are to receive transcriptomics training, to test the hypothesis that sterile inflammation is a universal driver of vertebral fusion, and to promote Clemson University?s genomics facility to Montana State University researchers. The PI will compare the transcriptional profiles of fusing chicken synsacrum intervertebral disc tissues to caudal non-fusing tissue by whole transcriptome RNAseq. Specifically, the PI will investigate the potential contributions of nucleus pulposus disc structures and inflammatory response to fusion in different axial regions of the chicken. These data will assess if ankylosis occurs via common or independent mechanisms, and will lend insight into avian axial evolution. Clemson University is ideal for these studies not only for its genomics facility, but also for its poultry farm, one of the few research poultry centers in academia. Training will include RNA extraction methods and bioinformatics analysis, including GO and KEGG profiling. The expertise gleaned from this collaboration will be applied to an RNAseq instructional module that will be built for MSU researchers to utilize Clemson?s genomics facility. MSU currently offers microarray, but not RNAseq services. These proposed studies will allow the PI to resolve vertebral fusion mechanism(s) in birds and ultimately expand the PI?s investigations to normal and pathological fusion in a variety of vertebrates, including mammalian disease models. Undergraduate mentorship and public education of science are deeply rooted in this project. The PI will continue to train existing students, recruit additional undergraduates, and pursue multiple and varied outreach efforts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will enable students from the seven tribal colleges in Montana and other Native students in the region to receive training in the preparation and submission of conference abstracts and in the development of effective communication skills for presentation of student research work. At least 60 Native students will be provided financial and technical support that will allow them to participate in the 34th National Conference on Undergraduate Research (NCUR), hosted by Montana State University (MSU) in March 2020. A pre-conference workshop will be held at MSU to enable students to work with faculty mentors to construct an abstract for submission to NCUR. Students will then be able to actively engage at the Conference by giving an oral/poster paper of their research. A special orientation session at NCUR will introduce students to the conference to maximize interaction and networking and to enhance the impact of the conference on student academic work and pursuit of a STEM career. This project will make it possible for most tribal college students in Montana and neighboring states to present their undergraduate research at NCUR 2020. The goal is to use the enthusiasm generated by the Nation?s premier undergraduate research event to advance knowledge, increase awareness, and foster the interest of Native students in graduate school and research-related careers.<br/><br/>Workshops, both pre-conference and at NCUR, will engage Native students to discussions on graduate education thru the Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP) panel, on STEM careers thru the Native professionals career panel, and on other Native student academic opportunities thru the Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR) topical sessions and affinity group social events. These events will build a sense of belonging and community for Native students during the conference.

However, continuing to build and maintain infrastructure using traditional, solely structural materials is environmentally and financially unsustainable. Sustainable infrastructure development represents a goal for the United States that can only be met through multi-purpose building materials that lower the overall energy and environmental footprint of our built environment. This project contributes to this national need by developing multi-functional and readily repairable infrastructure materials using immobilized microbial communities called ?biofilms?. Biofilms have the potential to meet diverse infrastructure needs and improve community and environmental health, including through cleaner air and water. This convergent project will leverage social sciences and broaden participation by involving groups that have been disproportionately impacted by environmental harms and infrastructure inequities to ensure new technologies are safe, acceptable, inclusive and beneficial.<br/><br/>The project goals are to: (1) structurally optimize infrastructure materials to enable multi-functionalization and on-demand repair through engineered living systems (i.e., biofilms); (2) provide flexibility in functionality via exchangeable, living ?treatment? cartridges and through permanent integration of biofilms into infrastructure; and (3) identify and address cultural, social and economic challenges that may impede adoption of engineered, living infrastructure materials through design improvements and evidence-based communication strategies. This work will address fundamental and applied questions regarding reactive transport optimization, hydrogel mechanics and fracturing, building-material optimization, and microbial community interactions. Coupling computationally supported reactive transport modeling with biofilm engineering experiments will generate new insights on how to control desired biofilm functions in infrastructure. Two of Montana State University?s centers for excellence, the Center for Biofilm Engineering and the Center for Science, Technology, Ethics, and Society, will collaborate to integrate Science, Technology, Ethics, and Society (STES) studies and Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) research. This holistic, innovative approach will allow for assessing and improving the adoption of transformative technologies by opening channels of feedback between stakeholders and the technical team and allowing for design changes to better meet community needs and expectations, particularly for its most vulnerable and marginalized members. Outcomes at the nexus of engineering, biology and social sciences will bolster NSF?s Big Idea of Understanding the Rules of Life and contribute to four of the top seven NSF 2026 Idea Machine topics. This project will work closely with groups that have been disproportionately impacted by environmental harms and infrastructure inequities (including American Indian and rural populations in Montana) and will involve these communities in the research directly to ensure new technologies are safe, acceptable, and beneficial.

These black holes have masses of millions or even billions of times the mass of our Sun. Sometimes black holes feed on surrounding gas or consume stars, ripping them apart along the way. These processes can release enormous amounts of energy, which can have a significant effect on the host galaxy. Despite the importance of supermassive black holes, their origin is far from understood. We do not know how the initial ?seed? black holes formed in the early Universe, how massive they were originally, or in what types of galaxies they formed. We do know, however, that larger galaxies host more massive black holes, suggesting galaxies and black holes grow together. Therefore, finding and studying the smallest ?dwarf? galaxies hosting supermassive black holes can provide clues to the origin of supermassive black holes. The investigator will study the properties of supermassive black holes in dwarf galaxies, leading to a better understanding of black hole formation and galaxy evolution. The research activities will directly relate to the investigator?s educational efforts to inspire Montana youth to engage in STEM and empower K-12 teachers to offer space-related activities in their classrooms. The investigator is a leader in the Montana Space Public Outreach Team (SPOT), which reaches 10,000 students each year in Montana.    SPOT is a science ambassador?s program in which undergraduates are trained to help teachers present science topics in high schools.<br/><br/>The investigator will (1) systematically search for supermassive black holes in dwarf galaxies using untapped multi-wavelength observations and a variety of techniques, (2) characterize the least-massive galaxies that can form a massive black hole, (3) estimate masses of the smallest black holes to constrain seed masses, (4) determine the accretion and radiative properties of low-mass black holes in dwarf galaxies, and (5) probe black hole feedback in dwarf galaxies to inform galaxy formation models at low masses. Finding and characterizing these systems is important for a holistic understanding of dwarf galaxy evolution and feedback, as well as advancing our understanding of the birth and growth of the first black holes in the earlier Universe.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Astronomy and Astrophysics Grant Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will develop and research storytelling as a culturally responsive way to engage middle school Native American and rural Montana students in learning computer science and computing skills. Instead of creating a new curriculum, the project will infuse computer science across the curriculum, which will help students understand that computing skills are relevant across disciplines and are important for a wide variety of professions in the workforce. The project will use Alice, an object-based educational programming environment, that has been successful by encouraging storytelling in engaging middle school students and others who are not normally exposed to programming. Using Alice, students can tell stories by placing objects in virtual worlds they have created, and then they can program by dragging and dropping tiles that represent logical structures.  By integrating these computational skills, without multiplying the number of topics to be taught, the project will promote a more diverse and comprehensive understanding of the opportunities available to students with an ability to think computationally. The project will develop resources for teachers to meet the requirements of Montana's Indian Education for All (IEFA) Act, which was mandated by the state legislature in 1999 and remains a difficult requirement for many middle school teachers to incorporate in their classrooms.  The project will serve over 300 students when piloting curriculum materials and will engage 50 teachers in professional development workshops on the integration of computer science and computational thinking across middle school curriculum using a storytelling approach.<br/><br/>The project will use a culturally responsive approach to infuse the use of storytelling (using Alice) in the curriculum, guided by Tribal Critical Theory (TribCrit), which maintains that cultural knowledge and academic knowledge are not mutually exclusive but complement each other.  The project tools, which will enable middle school teachers to integrate computer science and computational thinking throughout the curriculum, will be developed using a research-driven, iterative way to be culturally responsive to the communities served.  Project research will address two complementary research questions: (1) Do storytelling and storymaking serve as effective means for engaging middle-school students in computer science?; and (2) Does the integration of computing skills into the core middle-school curriculum increase instruction and student learning of these skills? In addition, the project will document the processes and evaluate the effectiveness of the TribCrit culturally responsive approach taken in integrating computer science and computational thinking into the middle school curriculum. A mixed-method approach will be used in the research, including focus groups, small group instructional diagnosis, surveys, and pre/post measures of computational thinking/computer science knowledge.  Project results will be disseminated through professional journals and conference presentations.  Selected student-created artifacts (i.e., Alice virtual worlds and stories) will be presented in Montana museums."

In this project, fifth- and sixth-grade Apsalooke youth will act as change agents through investigating water issues in their communities and presenting findings to their communities. They will conduct this water-related research in the context of an informal summer program designed to integrate Indigenous and Western perspectives on science. For example, youth will learn the cultural significance of water sites while also practicing methods for collecting and analyzing data relative to those sites, guided by Apsalooke elders and science professionals. During the summer program, Indigenous high school students and tribal college students will mentor the youth. To develop this program, the project team will conduct interviews with elders and Apsalooke community members in scientific fields to determine the desired features of a program that integrates Indigenous and Western science. They will use the findings from these interviews to develop a multimedia toolkit, which includes a set of comprehensive materials that will enable other researchers and informal educators to implement similar programs. This toolkit will include information about water science and water quality, lesson plans and related resources for the summer program, professional development materials to prepare the high school youth to act as mentors, handouts for family members to facilitate at-home engagement with their children, and more. The project team will research how the implementation of the toolkit influences the participants? water-related knowledge and attitudes toward science. The toolkit, and the associated empirical findings, will be disseminated widely through local, regional, and national professional networks that serve American Indians. <br/><br/>Montana State University, in partnership with Little Big Horn College, will implement and research an informal summer program for Apsalooke youth in the fifth and sixth grades, as well as a mentorship program for Indigenous high school students and tribal college students.

The high school and tribal college students will partner with Apsalooke elders and science professionals to facilitate and implement a two-week summer program for the fifth- and sixth-grade youth. This program will use the toolkit materials that were previously developed in consultation with elders and other community stakeholders. Regression analyses of validated pre- and post-surveys, as well as inductive analyses of interviews with stakeholders, will be used to study how the mentoring program affects the high school and tribal college students? attitudes toward science and career interests, and how the summer program affects the fifth- and sixth-graders? water-related knowledge. The research team will also study how youth participation in the program affects their family and community members? water-related knowledge. This project will result in a multimedia toolkit, freely available to the public and widely disseminated through professional networks, which specifies how other informal educators and researchers can implement similar mentorship programs and summer programs for Indigenous youth. Ultimately, this project will broaden participation through resulting in empirically-tested materials that advance practice in informal education for Indigenous youth and their communities.

Galectins are carbohydrate binding proteins involved in many physiological functions that involve how cells interact and communicate with other cells and are linked to diseases such as fibrosis, cancer and heart disease. A set of highly branched molecules, called glycodendrimers, with varied numbers of sugars displayed on their surfaces will be synthesized. These glycodendrimers will be used in biochemical, structural, and cell biological studies to investigate the effects that carbohydrate binding has on how galectins interact with each other and how these protein interactions affect cell-to-cell interactions. Under this project, the PI will reach out to students from diverse populations to bring these students into the Cloninger research group through outreach programs with Flathead Valley Community College (FVCC) and local high schools. In addition, Dr. Cloninger and her undergraduate and graduate students will present their research to chemistry classes at four local high schools and give interested high school students opportunities to perform microscopy experiments at Montana State University.<br/><br/>Although galectins play a critical role in cellular recognition processes through their binding interactions with cell surface carbohydrates, modulation of the interplay between their multivalent and monovalent functionalities is not well understood. Moreover, whether galectins from the three subfamilies have synergistic or distinct functions is currently unknown. The proposed research will use glycodendrimers to better understand galectin structure-function relationships. Lactose-functionalized glycodendrimers are ideal macromolecules with which to study multivalent carbohydrate-lectin interactions because both their size and the number of carbohydrate end groups can be systematically varied. Thus, glycodendrimers will be used to identify the role of the N-terminal domain in directing multivalent galectin-3/carbohydrate interactions. In addition, glycodendrimers will be used to evaluate whether galectins from the three subfamilies are working in concert to achieve increased specificity and selectivity in their multivalent interactions. Dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy and fluorescence microscopy will be employed to visualize glycodendrimer-lectin interactions. In addition, cellular uptake, and cellular aggregation assays using a series of glycodendrimers binding to galectin-3 and to mixtures of galectins will be performed. Elucidating the key principles that guide multivalent interactions in complex environments is essential for understanding the role of multivalent associations between cell surface carbohydrates and galectins.  In this regard, carbohydrate-functionalized dendrimers provide an ideal platform for the requisite systematic study of the role of multivalent interactions in carbohydrate-lectin binding.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There is broad recognition that solutions to these complex challenges will require environmental engineers to integrate concepts from engineering as well as the natural and physical sciences, social sciences, business, and communications to address the pressing challenges facing society at the individual, community, national, and global levels?across many sectors of the economy.  The existing environmental engineering undergraduate curriculum common today in the US fails to provide graduates with sufficient real-world skills to meet these modern environmental challenges.  The Department of Civil Engineering in the Norm Asbjornson College of Engineering at Montana State University (MSU) proposes to transform environmental engineering education by replacing current topic-focused course model with a four-year thematic thread curriculum that integrates technical, social, and economic competencies and provides students with repeated opportunities to address ill-defined, complex problems like those they will face as professionals.  The project is aligned with the NSF?s Revolutionizing Engineering Departments (RED) program mission to catalyze revolutionary approaches to engineering education. As an Adaptation and Implementation (A&I) project, it builds off evidence-based organizational change strategies employed at other institutions, applies ground-breaking pedagogical methods in the project's local context, and propagates the transformation of engineering education.<br/><br/>This project will develop an environmental engineering program around thematic threads of technical, social, and economic knowledge while developing a culture that rewards the use of best pedagogical practices for continuous professional formation throughout the undergraduate program.  Faculty will facilitate the transfer of knowledge from basic math, science, and humanities courses into the integrated project-based curriculum using a variety of proven, high-impact education practices and pedagogies, such as inquiry- and project-based learning.  First, faculty will apply a collaborative process to replace approximately 32 credits of topic-focused environmental engineering coursework, which would have been taken primarily in the final two years of the undergraduate program, with 32 credits of integrated courses distributed across the curriculum starting in the freshman year.  These new courses will serve as the mechanism to integrate the concepts covered in the remaining topic-focused courses that still comprise most of the undergraduate curriculum.  Second, faculty will develop appropriate problem-based learning activities for each year of the curriculum to provide students with practice solving a variety of open-ended and complex problems and gain experience in communication and teamwork.  Each project will build the knowledge and values necessary to allow for continuous professional development. Finally, faculty will develop systems and procedures that institutionalize faculty coordination, knowledge sharing, and training in best teaching practices.  Through this approach, the student experience will be transformed to one that develops an early, strong, and authentic engineering identity and provides the context and practice necessary for effective and continued independent learning.  Improved student retention, diversity, and professional competencies will result.

Forearc basins develop oceanward of the magmatic arc of a convergent margin and trap sediment in deep troughs. These basins can exist for tens to hundreds of millions of years, serving as a long-term record of past Earth environments, processes, climate regimes, and life. They also host natural resources such as oil and gas. The goal of this research is to determine the origin of forearc basins by investigating the relationship between the types of rocks that underlie the basin and the sedimentary rocks preserved within the basin. The research and education components of this project focus on increasing diversity in, and accessibility to, the geosciences through sustained engagement with underrepresented undergraduate students and middle school girls from rural communities in Montana. Students will participate in research design, field and laboratory work, and national conferences. Students also will help lead a STEM workshop for middle school girls focused on rocks and minerals from the western U.S. and Tibet. The project will resolve critical questions in the evolution of Earth and offer opportunities to students who traditionally have limited participation in the geosciences.<br/><br/>The mechanisms of forearc basin formation are not well understood because of poor preservation in the rock record or overprinting of primary tectonic and stratigraphic relationships by subsequent deformation. This research will test the hypothesis that extension of the underlying basement in a forearc region provides a mechanism to trap sediment and initiate basin subsidence as a precursor to forearc basin formation. The hypothesis will be tested by applying chronologic and geochemical methods to describe the tectonic setting of basement formation, timing and rates of basement-forearc development, and subsequent geologic history. The research will combine field mapping and sedimentology with sandstone petrography, biostratigraphy, geochronology, paleomagnetism, and low-temperature thermochronology. Field areas include the Great Valley forearc, California and the Xigaze forearc, Tibet. Each field area preserves primary relationships between basement and basin stratigraphy in similar, but not identical tectonic settings. The education plan integrates with the research activities by establishing the Montana State University Sedimentary Undergraduate Research program (MSU-SUR), which seeks to broaden the Earth Science community through sustained engagement with Native American and first-generation college students. Students in the MSU-SUR program will contribute directly to the research by participating in literature review and field planning, along with collecting and evaluating data and disseminating results.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Floodplains provide many important benefits to people, yet they are also susceptible to changes such as flooding, pollution, and other disturbances. Understanding the effects of long-term changes in river ecosystems affected by metal pollution is extremely important. This project studies changes over ten years in the Upper Clark Fork River in Montana following a large project that restored vegetation and removed contaminated soil after damage from extensive mining in the river?s headwaters. Changes in land use and wastewater treatment are also altering nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations along the river. Since 2013, nearly 17 km of river has been restored and three core data sets have been collected, which were initiated decades before the restoration. The long-term measurements and the spatial scale of the study provides an opportunity to observe the ecological processes involved in restoration practices. Several undergraduate and graduate students are educated as part of this project, data are made available to the public, and results are shared with many stakeholders in this river system through the Clark Fork Science Forum.<br/><br/><br/>The study system of the Upper Clark Fork River in Montana, has several unique qualities that enable this project to make significant scientific advances. First, the system has received high inputs of metals that have since ceased. This enables investigation of the ecosystem dynamics over time in response to this cessation. Second, the investigators have closely observed ecological and biogeochemical responses over decadal timescales, which is the appropriate timeframe to study the types of slow processes involved in river ecosystem recovery. The project generates core data sets including: 1) influences on organic matter and sediment metals, 2) changes in upstream-downstream gradients in sediment metals, 3) metabolic responses to floodplain reconnection in restored reaches during the spring flood pulse vs. summer baseflow, 4) changes in metal bioavailability caused by interaction with dissolved organic matter, and 5) measurements of nitrogen, phosphorus, and dissolved organic carbon in restored and unrestored parts of the river. Ultimately, this project investigates river ecosystem responses over large spatial (>200 km) and temporal (> decadal) scales.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These organic platforms are comprised of aromatic dyes, stacked in a face-to-face conformation and then covalently ?stapled? together with molecular tethers. The structural rigidity conferred by the tethers enables the construction of nanoscale objects that are structurally and electronically well-defined. By varying the physical rigidity of the tethers through synthetic chemistry, the researchers aim to show that energy transport is enhanced when the vibrations between individual molecules are reduced. To study this effect, the research team will use a variety of time-resolved spectroscopies and microscopies that allow direct imaging of energy transport through the nanostructures in the solid state. The overall scientific goal of this work is to provide a fundamental understanding of the level of disorder that can be tolerated in organic materials while still achieving long-range energy transport necessary for applications in catalysis and energy conversion. To broaden the impact of the work, the research team will develop a science communication channel on YouTube that is thematically centered on the role of chemistry in addressing contemporary problems in climate and energy and will leverage these materials to develop a co-hosted general audience seminar series at UM and MSU.<br/><br/>Exciton diffusion lengths in organic nanostructures are often measured in the 10s of nanometers, rather than the micron length scale of inorganic semiconductors. Only a few examples of long-range exciton transport have been reported for organic materials, however these demonstrations are serendipitous, and to date, a fundamental understanding of the relevant structure-function relationships that ensure long range exciton transport is lacking. This project leverages a class of covalently tethered molecular assemblies that feature synthetic ?knobs? to regulate both dynamic (electron-phonon coupling) and static heterogeneity (length of tethered dye assemblies) without changing the molecular core through which excitons are transported. Exciton transport in a series of increasingly rigidified assemblies will be measured using a variety of ultrafast spectroscopies and microscopies, both in solution and in the solid state. Experimental data from both solution and solid-state spectroscopic studies will be compared to structurally-accurate kinetic Monte Carlo models, which will be utilized to extract fundamental constraints on the structural and electronic parameters that engender long range exciton transport. Results from these combined studies will deliver new fundamental insight into: 1) how excited state properties of solvated assemblies, such as exciton delocalization and diffusion, can be tailored by tuning interchromophore rigidity, and 2) how exciton transport properties are parameterized by structural domain heterogeneity in hierarchical superstructures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Silicone oils and rubbers are hydrophobic, colorless, and electrically insulating materials and as such find wide uses. Recently, two families of silicon-containing polymers were developed wherein silicon-containing building blocks alternate with fluorescent ones. Unlike most known silicon-based materials, these polymers are intensely colored, brightly fluorescent, and behave as semiconductors. Importantly, they still retain key properties of traditional silicones, such as water and flame resistance. Semiconducting polymers, such as, organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) are found in flat panel displays and in some instances can be used to convert sunlight into electricity. Hence the study of these new polymer families could lead to unexpected and potentially useful properties, bringing new, low-cost and more robust materials to many everyday societal applications. This research project will facilitate the training of graduate and undergraduate students to expand knowledge of these materials and their behavior. <br/><br/>Silsesquioxanes (SQs) are unique, regularly symmetric 3D macromolecules that resemble single silica crystals  in being extremely robust, some remaining air-stable up to 600 C. The phenyl derivatives of SQs can also be selectively functionalized by using electrophilic substitution reactions. The cage centers interact with appended moieties in the excited state providing 3D conjugation (cage centered LUMOs) and semiconducting behavior. There is potential to develop new families of polymers with semiconducting properties wherein siloxane bridges offer potential value for photonic applications, for example for displays, hybrid lasers and photovoltaics. These avenues of scientific inquiry, which constitute the basis for the broad collaboration, aim at expanding the number of cage architectures that form the presumed cage centered LUMOs, detailing the substitution patterns required to promote onset of such properties, and optimizing one- and two-photon quantum efficiencies for display, white light and laser applications. These goals will be pursued through detailed photophysical measurements, theoretical modeling, and electrochemical probing with the aim of improving fundamental understanding of structure-property relationships in this polymer family. The potential exists to make available important new sets of semiconducting polymers for chemists, physicists and materials scientists and engineers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such communities are key players in all geochemical cycles; they are present in all multicellular organisms, including humans, where in addition to possibly harmful effects, they also have essential beneficial roles. They are ubiquitous in engineered systems as well where, again, they can be beneficial (e.g., waste water treatment) or harmful (e.g., drinking water distribution). In large part, microbial communities interactions with their environments are metabolic through chemicals they take in, products they make with these inputs, and byproducts they excrete, so understanding these metabolic capabilities is essential for understanding how microbes effect their surroundings. Advances in genetic sequencing are making it easier and easier to determine microbial ""machinery"" (enzymes); researchers are becoming increasingly adept in predicting how this ""machinery"" combines into ""assemblage lines"" (metabolic pathways). Armed with this knowledge, the next step is to understand how these ""assembly lines"" fit into their environment into a sort of large scale ""distribution system"" that determines overall microbial community function. At large scale, this becomes a challenging computational problem, and current methods are not adequate. This project aims to accelerate these computations by introducing machine learning tools into key bottlenecks in the algorithms. The project is a collaboration between Temple University, Montana State University, and the University of  California, San Diego and offers valuable educational, training, and outreach opportunities. <br/> <br/>Activity funded by this proposal would center on development of computational methods, based on machine learning and artificial intelligence assisted optimization, that are sufficiently efficient so as to make it possible to embed complex cell-scaled models of microbial behavior (metabolic and gene expression models, so-called ME modes) into environmental scale PDE-based models of microbial community activity. In support of this effort, ME models of several specific organisms (S. aureus, S. epidermidis, B. subtilis) will be adapted for use in specific environmental-scale models (basic biofilm communities and built-environment subaerial communities).

Scale-independence and locality are two favorable and tenable features of quantum observables.  Scale-independence lends to stable phases of matter that can be codified via a field of mathematics called topology.  Observables possess locality if each observation on a large region of space-time is determined by those on smaller domains, such as by point- or line-observables.  Point-, line-, plane-, ? -observables organize as a mathematical entity known as a higher category, which is a higher-dimensional graph.  Factorization homology is a device that assembles such localized observables to global observables on space-time and it possesses several structural features that give a theory advantage once cast as so.  Generally, it offers conceptual and combinatorial access to long-distance/long-time quantum theory, notably even to ones that are not determined by their point-observables.  To integrate research and education between students and researchers, and to increase mathematics and physics activity in the EPSCoR State of Montana and its surrounding states, the PI will organize two conferences.  These conferences will bring together renowned researchers in mathematical physics, and will draw regional participation.  The PI will compile and disseminate literature for bias-sensitive selection processes for such events.  The PI will produce and publicly post two video series.  One series will behold research-level mathematics generated through activities related to this award.  The other series will be for experimental in-class instruction for upper-division mathematics classes.  <br/> <br/>The project continues the development and explicit identification of the theory of factorization homology for higher categories, partly in collaboration with John Francis.  Factorization homology can be conceived as the study of sheaves on moduli spaces of stratifications, much like Beilinson-Drinfeld?s construction of conformal blocks in terms of sheaves on Ran spaces.  One goal is to fulfill an essential aspect of this theory: the exact relationship between orthogonal groups and higher categorical adjunctions.  A consequence of such a relationship is a proof of the cobordism hypothesis, of Baez-Dolan and Lurie, after Atiyah.  Another goal is to recover known, and establish new, manifold and tangle invariants from representation theoretic data.  Expected examples of such include the Jones polynomial, and Reshetikhin-Turaev's invariant.  Now, factorization homology depends continuously in diffeomorphisms/isotopies; it possesses subtle functoriality and local-to-global principles; it is expected to carry natural filtrations as well as a general form of Poincare/Koszul duality.  Such a goal thusly lends advantage for computational access to manifold and tangle invariants arising through representation theory.  Such a goal also lends to surprising dualities between state-sum type topological quantum field theories and sigma-model type field theories.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While the fingerprint of oxygen on the cycling of elements in the geosphere and biosphere over geological time is increasingly coming into focus, key questions remain on the nature of the dynamic feedbacks between the coupled evolution of the geosphere and the biosphere and on the timescales over which key events took place. New data suggests that the co-evolution of organisms that characteristically inhabit acidic hot springs (thermoacidophiles) and the acidic nature of the hot spring habitats themselves was likely driven by a series of geobiological feedbacks that have taken place over the past one billion years, near to the time when atmospheric oxygen is thought have reached near present-day levels. These unique low complexity acidic ecosystems provide an opportunity to test and further develop integrated concepts in the geosciences, including identifying the dynamics between the coupled evolution of geochemical habitats and the metabolic potential of their microbial inhabitants. The new understanding and analytical tools that are developed from the study of low complexity acidic ecosystems will be applicable to more complex ecosystems and processes, including those that have direct bearing on the geobiological feedbacks that sustain plant, animal, and environmental health. Results from these studies will be disseminated by students, postdocs, and the senior scientists supported by the project through presentations at national and international conferences and through submission of journal articles, thereby boosting professional development. <br/><br/>There is widespread recognition of the role of feedbacks between biological and geological processes in the co-evolution of environmental landscapes and the biodiversity they support. However, far less is known of the nature of these feedbacks and the time scales over which they occur, especially from the biological perspective. This is due, in part, to the complexity of most contemporary ecosystems and the difficulty this presents in deconvoluting the geobiological interactions that have shaped these habitats and their inhabitants. This knowledge gap prevents the development of a more complete understanding of the generation of biological diversity, both today and in the geological past, and perhaps more importantly, limits our ability to link geochemical and biological biomarkers in the rock record. New data suggests that the evolution of thermoacidophilic microorganisms and the largescale generation of acidic habitats was likely driven by a series of geobiological feedbacks that have taken place over the past one billion years. More specifically, data indicates that at least two divergent archaeal lineages converged evolutionarily upon similar, oxygen-dependent metabolic strategies to survive acid conditions, and we have hypothesized that, in doing so, they have constructed highly acidic ecological niches. In this work we will address this hypothesis by combining field- and laboratory-based analyses aimed at defining constraints on the kinetics of abiotic and biotic sulfur oxidation, the physiology of thermoacidophiles, and the coupled evolution of acidic habitats and their thermoacidophilic inhabitants. Specifically, we will apply state of the art molecular, physiological, evolutionary, geochemical, and modeling approaches to test our primary hypothesis that taxonomic and functional diversity of microorganisms in acidic hot spring environments evolved in concert with the oxygen-dependent, biologically induced acidification of those environments. In this work, we will evaluate the influence of oxygen on (i) the kinetics of sulfur oxidation over a pH and temperature continuum, (ii) the adaptations that facilitate habitation along this continuum and, (iii) the co-evolution of these lineages and their acidic habitats. Completion of this project will culminate in a more complete understanding of how interactions between microorganisms and their environment can lead to biological diversification and geological change, using thermoacidophiles and their acidic hot spring habitats as a model. New understanding and bioinformatics tools that we develop from the study of these low complexity ecosystems will be applicable to more complex ecosystems and processes. Results will be disseminated by students, postdocs, and the PI through presentations at national and international conferences and through submission of journal articles, thereby boosting professional development. Through this work, we will continue to recruit and offer research opportunities to motivated undergraduate and graduate students, particularly underrepresented Native Americans. To achieve this goal, we will continue the partnership that has been forged with Salish Kootenai College to attract undergraduates to complete a six-week summer research internship at Montana State University, with the goal of recruiting students from this demographic to seek an advanced degree in a STEM discipline.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Laboratory experiments play a key role in the professional formation of chemical engineers, who use experiments in industry to develop innovative products, in research to conduct studies, and in design to gather information and test solutions. Yet at many institutions, laboratory courses have remained relatively unchanged, and modernizing efforts have primarily focused on updating equipment, content, and procedures. There are many different decisions students could make ? in other words, many ways they could have agency ? from choosing variables to choosing which audience to report their results to. This project will evaluate the effect of giving students differing levels of agency throughout the experiment on the students? lab experience. The ACEE project will study chemical engineering laboratory courses at the University of New Mexico and Montana State University to better understand how such courses can better support student development toward independent problem-solving and communication, thus producing graduates better prepared for the challenges of professional engineering. <br/><br/>The primary aim of the ACEE project is to extend theory about how consequential agency functions to support learning and engineering identity. Past research has connected agency, learning, and identity, and provided insights into both benefits of and barriers to high-agency learning experiences. To identify experiences critical to professional formation, the ACEE Project will investigate students? agency in four domains: (1) experimental design prior to doing the lab; (2) experimental oversight during the lab, including variables to manipulate, data collection frequency, and documentation during their experiments; (3) data analysis and interpretation; and (4) communication of their purpose, methods, and conclusions. This project extends recent research on agency to answer the following research questions: (1) To what extent do existing laboratory experiments offer students consequential agency in the four domains (i.e., experimental design, experimental oversight, data analysis, communication)?  (2) To what extent does perceived consequential agency in the four domains contribute to students? sense of belonging in engineering/engineering identity and learning how to design and report experiments? (3) Across these, are there differences between minoritized and privileged groups? The team will examine the agency students might have, differentiating between lower agency and consequential agency, which is defined as having and taking up opportunities to make decisions that are consequential to how students learn, to what students learn, and to the learning activities themselves. In the context of a laboratory experiment, this means that students can make decisions that affect later steps of their work; for instance, if students choose some parameters of their experiment, this impacts the data they collect and the kinds of analysis they will do. The ACEE Project will investigate existing upper-division, undergraduate laboratory experiments across two chemical engineering programs which will offer a chance to conduct comparisons of various existing and common teaching approaches. Students? opportunities for consequential agency in specific domains will be assessed using the Agency Levels in Learning Opportunities Tool (ALLOT) while students? perceptions of agency and engineering identity will be measured using surveys. By answering the proposed questions, the ACEE Project will extend a more nuanced understanding of the criticality of agency in the conjoined learning/identity-formation process.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will develop curricula that bring recent advances in STEM knowledge of mathematical modeling into undergraduate elementary teacher education. Mathematical modeling is the process of using mathematics to make sense of real-world, authentic problems and it provides powerful learning opportunities for all students. Although modeling is of growing importance, few preservice K-8 teachers have knowledge of what modeling is or have experienced it firsthand. It is important for them to experience modeling as learners before they can integrate modeling into teaching. This project aims to address this need through the design, enactment, and refinement of mathematical modeling modules for preservice teachers. The project will use design-theory methodology to examine multiple facets of the teaching and learning of modeling beyond content knowledge.  <br/><br/>This collaborative project will involve Montana State University and Marquette University, and various undergraduate courses at each institution. The project will gather data from various sources, including classroom video data,  and preservice teachers' constructed models and journals.  The project team will use this data to document, through a Decision Modeling Process, how preservice teachers move through the modeling cycle, noting specific choices, actions, and dispositions. This information will then be used to refine the developed instructional modules and provide written and video annotations for these modules. Based on this analysis, the project seeks to address: 1) how teacher educators can support preservice teachers' understanding of the attributes of mathematical modeling; 2) how preservice teachers' understanding of modeling develops across modules; and 3) factors that support preservice teachers' motivation to engage in mathematical modeling and its related practices. The modules and corresponding videos and annotations developed by the project will be accessible online and will be shared with mathematics teacher educators through outlets such as webinars and conferences. Through dissemination of the modules, mathematics teacher educators will have visible resources to aid in integrating mathematical modeling into a range of existing courses, including undergraduate mathematical modeling courses, preservice teacher methods courses, and undergraduate mathematics courses for teachers. More broadly, this project has potential to benefit society by improving the preparation of undergraduate students, who will become multi-disciplinary teachers in a STEM field. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students.

SIRs are formed when the fast solar wind interacts with the slow solar wind in front of it, creating a magnetic compression region (which may or may not form a shock). These compression regions are efficient particle accelerators and can initiate geomagnetic storms. These SIRs also can cause geomagnetic induced currents, which are measured by ground-based magnetometers. The project will integrate this work with educational outreach by starting the Space Weather UnderGround program that creates curriculum resources for high school teachers and puts scientific equipment in the classroom, beneficial to both students and scientists. Additionally, to increase public understanding of space weather, the PI will create a class called ?The Sun and Society? to meet the natural sciences requirement at Montana State. The PI is an early career female faculty member in an EPSCoR state and the project is interdisciplinary and co-funded by the Solar-Terrestrial Research and Magnetospheric Physics programs.<br/><br/>To better understand how SIRs evolve as a function of radial distance this project will answer the following science questions: (1) How do compressions (often but not always shocks) associated with SIRs/CIRs steepen between 1 au and 5.4 au? How do these compressional changes relate to the co-located particle populations? (2) How do the compression ratios, density ratios, and onset timing, as predicted by the WSA- ENLIL model as run by the NSF/NASA supported Community Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMC), compare to the observed data at Maven and Juno? (3) Is there a direct relationship between the compression ratio of a SIR and if there is a dB/dt (a GIC proxy) signal? This proposal will use data from NASA spacecraft near Earth, near Mars, and then a spacecraft as it was on its way to Jupiter to understand the radial evolution and co-located particles. The PI will link the compression ratios to how strong of GICs they can produce and at what latitudes. This effort will require the CCMC to forecast the arrival times of the SIRs at the various spacecraft. Finally, the project will use data from SuperMAG to link the SIR-induced GICs to their compressional strength and look for latitudinal dependencies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Effective thermal management technologies are essential to cool these devices to a safe temperature to sustain their high performance. Thin film evaporation, based on continuous evaporation of very thin films of liquid coolant, is a promising cooling strategy due to its simple design, high cooling capacity, and high stability. By incorporating micro/nano-structures such as micro-pillars and nano-pores, the cooling capacity of thin film evaporation has been significantly improved in recent years but is still much lower than theory predictions, due to the lack of fundamental understanding, especially the detailed flow and thermal characteristics at microscopic and nanoscopic scales. This CAREER project seeks to study fluid flow and thermal transport processes at evaporating interfaces by accurately measuring the flow speed, film shape and temperature within thin coolant films that are typically a few micrometers thick. The knowledge gained will be integrated into educational and outreach activities by establishing a thermal-fluid instructional laboratory at Montana State University and creating educational materials targeting the general public and school children with a special emphasis on those from rural communities and underrepresented groups.<br/> <br/>The overarching goal of this project is to advance the fundamental understanding of the flow, thermal transport, and contact line dynamics at evaporating interfaces via quantifying 3D velocity fields, interface temperature, and interface profile, enabled by innovative experiments and modeling efforts. Specifically, the project team will (i) employ combined astigmatism particle tracking velocimetry, fluorescence thermometry and interference microscopy to perform measurements on micro-structured surfaces, (ii) quantify film temperature and meniscus dynamics within nanopores using nanoscale quantum dot thermometers and environmental scanning electron microscopy, and (iii) develop a microscale model for thin film evaporation on micro-structured surfaces with improved accuracy by incorporating Marangoni flows. The research will characterize the wicking dynamics, liquid-vapor interface temperature, curvature and meniscus dynamics of thin evaporating films with high spatial and temporal resolutions, which will allow precise determination of the accommodation coefficient and the quantification of Marangoni effects, thus filling in current knowledge gaps and informing the next generation of predictive tools.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Thermal Transport Processes Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the past, this heat source resulted in large-volume volcanic eruptions that created many of the rocks we see scattered across the landscape today. Because Yellowstone is a federally protected and active volcanic center, scientists have an obligation to understand the geologic history and possible hazards of such a massive volcanic system and to convey this information to the communities and people that visit each year. This project aims to systematically investigate the youngest supereruption, the Lava Creek Tuff, which produced the modern-day Yellowstone caldera. The questions to be addressed include: (1) how was magma positioned beneath the surface? (2) what may have triggered the magma to move to the surface? (3) where did magma erupt from? and (4) how long (days, weeks, years) did it take for all of these processes to occur? Throughout this project, the researchers will be training the next generation of geologists to develop their skills as scientists and communicators. Yellowstone provides an ideal setting to teach skills related to geologic mapping, critical thinking, and rock analysis, which is why this proposal is structured to provide eight undergraduate and three graduate students with summer mapping experiences, with an emphasis on recruiting students from underrepresented backgrounds. All students will be trained to be active stewards of Yellowstone science, writing blog articles and preparing presentations that communicate to the public the geology and monitoring of Yellowstone Volcano.<br/> <br/>The mechanisms and timescales by which large volumes of rhyolitic magma accumulate, are stored in the upper crust and are triggered to eruption remain fundamental questions in volcanology. The overall Research Objective of this proposal is to reevaluate the assemblage, storage and eruption dynamics of the youngest supereruption from the Yellowstone Volcanic Field (YVF), the Lava Creek Tuff (LCT; 0.63 Ma). This work was ignited by the 2018 discovery of two new ignimbrite units previously unrecognized (and currently spatially unconstrained) as belonging to the LCT. Additionally, hints of inter-depositional chemical variations within the LCT exist in the established literature but are currently poorly defined. The working hypothesis of this proposal is that the LCT eruption consisted of multiple magma bodies tapped differentially along the caldera boundary, comparable to what is inferred in the better-studied Huckleberry Ridge Tuff, the oldest (2.08 Ma) supereruption from the YVF. Through a combination of detailed field mapping, extensive whole rock, glass geochemistry and petrographic analysis, diffusion modeling and age dating, this project will rethink the makeup and progression of the youngest Yellowstone supereruption. The Educational Objective of this study is to leverage the proximity (1.5 hours) of Montana State University to one of the largest volcanic systems on Earth, using it as a field-based laboratory for training the next generation of geologists. This project presents numerous opportunities for practicing science communication in light of over 4 million tourists that visit the park each year.

These reactions are valuable for forming carbon-carbon, carbon-nitrogen, and other types of bonds for the construction of complex organic molecules for use in drug design, the design of new biomaterials, and other advanced manufacturing applications. In cross coupling reactions the control of reaction selectivity is often challenging. If the catalyst cannot differentiate between several possible reaction sites on the molecules, a mixture of products will result. Purification of that mixture increases cost and waste. In this project, Dr. Neufeldt is developing catalysts for cross coupling that efficiently differentiate between similar reactive sites. Both laboratory-based and computational studies are being employed to understand how the  catalyst structure influences the way the catalyst interacts with subtly different sites. This information is being used to design improved catalysts to achieve higher selectivity and efficiency. As part of this project, Dr. Neufeldt is involved in activities to encourage participation of underrepresented minorities in scientific research and improve computational chemistry education at the undergraduate level. These activities include involving students from neighboring tribal colleges in computational chemistry research, implementing computational chemistry labs into the organic curriculum at Montana State University, and engaging in outreach to local schools and tribal colleges. <br/><br/>Dr. Neufeldt is identifying and exploiting new mechanisms by which phosphine and N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands can influence site selectivity in nickel (Ni)- and palladium (Pd)-catalyzed cross coupling reactions. Phosphine ligands are being studied for their ability to control selectivity between phenol derivatives and chlorides in Ni-catalyzed cross couplings. In addition, NHC ligands are under investigation for their ability to influence selectivity between aryl triflates and chlorides in Pd-catalyzed couplings. The origin of selectivity in these systems is examined through a combination of experimental and computational studies. Density functional theory is also employed to design new site-selective catalysts on the computer. The work in this project is valuable for improving the functional group tolerance of cross couplings, facilitating sequential or iterative couplings, and providing insight into catalyst structure-selectivity relationships.

There are two research thrusts in this CAREER endeavor. The first is to understand the conditions needed to create additive manufacturing filaments that can successfully encapsulate heat-sensitive biologically derived enzymatic constituents, such that their biological activity is substantially retained upon thermoplastic processing into final composites. The amount of thermal shielding will be quantified by analyzing the environmental degradability of complete composite samples manufactured via microfluidic controls of material extrusions through custom-design print-heads for fused filament fabrications. The second thrust is to explore the processing and properties of electrically-conductive components using the developed methods to hierarchically structure multi-material systems.

The long-term goal of this project is to transform how, where, and when these materials can be produced as well as who can participate in their manufacturing. The specific goal is to improve the ability to make complex, load-bearing structures through microbial biomineralization. The successful completion of this project will benefit society through the generation of fundamental knowledge about the control of microbes to build, assemble, repair, and reuse or recycle building materials. Additional benefits to society will be achieved through student education and training including the mentoring of three graduate students and up to 15 undergraduate students at Montana State University (MSU).<br/><br/>Concrete, which includes cement along with fine and coarse aggregates, is ubiquitous in building materials. Concrete requires increasingly scarce materials such as high-quality sand while cement requires high energy, time, labor, and material resources to manufacture. Cement manufacturing also has a high carbon footprint. This research advances the eco-manufacturing of sustainable building materials using microbes by addressing several key challenges that limit how current biomineralized structures are built, repaired, and recycled. The specific research objectives are to 1) improve spatial control of biomineralization through strategies including functionalizing surfaces to bio-trap microbes and 3D printing; 2) engineer biological glues and/or layer-by-layer deposition of biomineralized scaffolds to assemble more complex biomineralized structures; 3) activate an embedded biomineralizing bacteria, fungi, or enzymes or external microbial or enzyme delivery to facilitate in-situ repair; and 4) explore repurposing or recycling biomineralized structures aided by material breakdown or re-mineralization by microorganisms. The successful completion of this research will improve future manufacturing through advancing technology needed for on-site production, re-use, and repair of complex material structures, particularly in resource-limited settings. To implement the education and workforce goals of the project, the team plans to develop an eco-manufacturing course and training modules as well as biomineralization activity outreach to K-12 students through existing MSU programs and teachers through an existing Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) program. Additionally, a workforce development program, Eco-Manufacturing Student Research and Train (Eco-Start), will train up to 15 undergraduate students through academic and industry laboratory work experiences to prepare them for employment and leadership in eco-manufacturing.<br/><br/>This Future Manufacturing award was jointly funded by the Division of Translational Impacts (TI) in the Directorate for Technology, Innovation and Partnerships (TIP), the Divisions of Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation (CMMI) and Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport Systems (CBET) in the Directorate for Engineering (ENG), and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) in the Office of Integrated Activities (OIA) in the Office of the Director (OD).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, natural processes driven by plate tectonics mean that this sedimentary record is inherently incomplete. At different times during Earth?s history, some regions experienced sediment deposition, which buries and therefore heats up rocks, while other regions experienced erosion, which both removes portions of the rock record and cools off the rocks that persist by bringing them closer to Earth?s surface. This study will use the geochemical signatures of rock heating and cooling that occurs during deposition and erosion to understand the geologic histories of areas where no sedimentary rocks remain. Specifically, the study will investigate the ancient record of supercontinent breakup, a process that drives changes in sea level, global climate, and topography. This project will provide support for three early-career researchers at different universities, including two women, and build new relationships among the collaborating research groups. Three graduate and nine undergraduate students from different universities will be engaged in collaborative, hypothesis-driven research and learn a range of field, laboratory, and science communication methods. The researchers will also collaborate with the Idaho Museum of Natural History to create a mobile museum exhibit that will highlight the ancient history of the charismatic mountain ranges in the study area and visit museums that serve rural communities in the Rocky Mountains.<br/><br/>Unconformities, which are abundant in the rock record, are traditionally viewed as unfillable gaps in the rock record of Earth?s history. However, the thermal imprint of sedimentary cover on the basement rocks that underlie many unconformities provides a rich archive of the otherwise inaccessible parts of a continent?s tectonic history. This record is now accessible due to recent conceptual and analytical advances in low-temperature thermochronology. The primary objective of this study is to contribute to these advances by targeting a critical gap in knowledge about Laurentian tectonics, the breakup of supercontinent Rodinia, while establishing an approach to deep-time thermochronology that can document Precambrian tectonic activity in regions that also experienced significant Phanerozoic mountain building. This study will sample along a 700-kilometer-long segment of western Laurentia?s rifted margin, targeting basement rocks directly below the Great Unconformity and using four chronometers to produce holistic tectonothermal histories to fill a billion-year gap in the rock record. This study will demonstrate how deep time thermochronology can provide a new perspective on the geometry and tectonic evolution of western Laurentia?s rifted margin, where much or all of the sedimentary record of Neoproterozoic tectonism is missing. This capability will be tested by (1) establishing a clear link between extant Neoproterozoic sedimentary rocks and Neoproterozoic tectonothermal events in the Uinta Mountains, (2) documenting the Proterozoic thermal histories of basement blocks with no overlying Neoproterozoic strata in the Teton Range and southwestern Montana, and (3) quantifying intra-mountain range variability of Proterozoic thermal histories to evaluate the sampling spatial resolution necessary for extracting meaningful tectonic information from the deep-time thermochronologic record.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Within the central nervous system, physiological levels of calcium play an important role in neural activity and in transporting signals across neuronal networks. In contrast, highly elevated levels of calcium ions are associated with dysfunctional communication and can lead to the degeneration of the neuronal network. Recently, it has been demonstrated that magnetic nanoparticles can be used to mechanically open calcium channels allowing calcium ions to enter neurons through the cell membrane. How this intentional, force-mediated influx of calcium ions interacts with structures inside neurons and how it spreads within a neuronal network is highly important for understanding force-mediated brain cell communication and degenerative diseases. This award will fund a research program that links nanomaterials to neurobiological systems and aims to capture and to quantify calcium signal transport in experimentally grown, controlled neuronal networks. Both graduate and undergraduate students involved in the project will benefit from an enhanced research infrastructure combining nanotools and neuroengineering. These nanotools will also become available to a broader research community interested in analyzing changes in communication patterns during degeneration or stem cell development. Finally, the project will involve the creation of an interdisciplinary bio micro-electro-mechanical system (BioMEMS) course to advance the STEM workforce in Montana, and science communication summer workshops for students specifically interested in transforming engineering data into visual arts. <br/><br/>Stimulation through nanomagnetic forces is a tool that operates magnetic nanoparticles within magnetic fields to impose a mechanical force on associated objects. Within a biological context, this project considers brain cells that express mechanically sensitive ion channels and receptors as the target for nanomagnetic stimulation. Applying nanomagnetic forces to the membrane of neural networks in vitro has been shown to trigger an influx of calcium ions, recently. How the force stimulation relates to other neurophysiological events, however, remains unknown. In particular, the integration of subcellular biomechanics with innovative neuronal cell screening platforms has not been used in combination with nanomagnetic force stimulation, previously. This knowledge gap currently limits the broader experimental applicability of nanomagnetic stimulation. Hence, this project addresses current limitations of nanomagnetic force stimulation by unraveling how neuron-to-neuron communication is impacted by force-mediated intracellular changes in calcium signaling. The proposed work will systematically analyze how fast this force-mediated calcium influx in neuronal networks occurs, and how the architecture of a neuronal network impacts the spatial transport of evoked signals. Calcium fluorometry will be employed in combination with electrophysiology to assess the spatiotemporal aspects of subcellular calcium stimulation in rodent primary neurons. Furthermore, this project develops highly parallelized arrays of cell nano-manipulation and assessment tools with low-resolution live-cell calcium imaging to map calcium signal propagation across neuronal cultures. Research results from this proposal will pave the way to future use of mechanical stimulation as a precise neurophysiological tool. Based on this knowledge, the project will develop design guidelines for future neuro-therapeutics using magnetic nanoparticle-mediated force stimulation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A major challenge for the large-scale cultivation of microalgae is the lack of understanding about how microbial communities affect algae growth. This interdisciplinary research and training project will use microbiology and molecular biology approaches, combined with engineering and computer modeling approaches, to bridge gaps in the understanding of algal microbiome interactions to achieve maximum productivity and culture stability. The research approaches and results will be transferrable to other natural and industrial systems relevant to society such as wastewater treatment, nutrient cycling, and nutraceutical production.

These predictions will be tested using well-defined experiments including next generation sequencing and physiology studies enabling observation of carbon and nitrogen exchange at both the culture and single-cell levels. Iterative refinement of modeling and experiments will lead to an in-depth understanding and ultimately optimization of community productivity, robustness, and stability.

A greener alternative to using fossil resources is bio-based polymers.  The project investigates more efficient chemical processing for the production of 2,5- furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) ? a bio-based chemical that can be upgraded to polymers analogous to fossil-derived polyethylene terephthalate (PET), which is widely used in the production of films, polyesters, and nylons.  The corresponding FDCA based polymer (polyethylene furanoate, or PEF) is particularly attractive for food and beverage packaging, such as plastic bottles, and is estimated to be a $200 billion market.  However, FDCA is produced via oxidation of a biomass precursor, 5- hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), which has several major production limitations.  This project addresses several challenges associated with the manufacture of FDCA from HMF, thus enabling more economical production of PEF and its related products.<br/><br/>The project addresses several challenges of FDCA synthesis by improving the reaction using organic solvents and heterogeneous catalysts.  In particular, the project focuses on fundamental aspects related to the interactions of solvents, reactants, and products with the surface and active sites of the catalysts. Specifically, the research focuses on two main limitations of FDCA production: catalyst activity and product concentration. Identifying solvents that have high FDCA solubility in the absence of salts will significantly improve the range of heterogenous catalysts that can be used in the reaction.  Bimetallic and non-noble metal catalysts will be synthesized using atomic layer deposition (ALD) in order to achieve uniform catalyst particle dispersion, while also controlling particle size, structure, and composition. The ALD-synthesized catalysts provide a platform conducive to identifying catalyst properties that enable efficient HMF-to-FDCA conversion, while providing fundamental insight regarding the surface reactions involved.  Additionally, base-free reactions at high HMF concentrations will be run to elucidate reactant/product/solvent interactions with the catalysts.  Beyond the technical aspects, the project integrates research with education at all levels, especially via efforts targeted towards underrepresented minorities with the goal of motivating young students to consider the STEM fields as a possible career path.  To that end, sustained contact will be made with over 120 4th graders in under-served, rural areas of Montana.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the increased frequency and severity of wildfires in forested watersheds  are adversely impacting  downstream water quality due to the exports of sediments, nutrients, and dissolved organic matter. Heat from wildfires initiates and catalyzes a series of chemical reactions in soil organic matter that result in the formation of pyrogenic organic matter (PyOM). In a wildfire impacted watershed, PyOM has the potential to impact surface water quality, aquatic biogeochemical processes, and the operation of downstream water treatment plants. The overarching goal of this project is to evaluate the chemical composition, environmental fate and reactivity, and timing of PyOM release from a wildfire impacted watershed. To advance this goal, the Principal Investigators (PIs) propose to carry out an integrated laboratory and field research program to 1) characterize the chemical composition of PyOM using optical spectroscopy and ultra-high resolution mass spectrometry, 2) evaluate the environmental fate of PyOM during photodegradation and biodegradation, and 3) monitor the timing of PyOM export from a wildfire-impacted watershed with in-situ optical sensors. The successful completion of this project will benefit society through the generation of new fundamental knowledge and data to advance the assessment and evaluation of the environmental fate and transport of PyOM in forested watersheds and its potential impact on downstream water quality. Additional benefits to society will be achieved through outreach and education activities including the mentoring of one graduate student at Texas A&M University and one graduate student at Washington State University.<br/><br/>Wildfires can drastically change the quantity and quality of dissolved organic matter (DOM) that is exported from burned watersheds to downstream surface water systems due to the formation of pyrogenic organic matter (PyOM). The presence of PyOM in wildfire-impacted watersheds has the potential to impact aquatic biogeochemical processes and the removal of organic matter during drinking water treatment. The goal of this project is to evaluate the chemical composition, environmental stability, and timing of dissolved PyOM export from wildfire-impacted watersheds. The specific objectives of the research are to: (1) Evaluate the differences in chemical compositions between background DOM and PyOM; (2) Assess the fate of PyOM during biodegradation, photodegradation, and photobiodegradation; and (3) Evaluate the timing of PyOM release from a wildfire-impacted watershed using in situ optical sensors. PyOM generated from water leaching experiments of laboratory-heated soils will be characterized by elemental composition, optical measurements, and ultra-high resolution mass spectrometry. A multi-year field campaign will evaluate the temporal dynamics of PyOM release from a wildfire-impacted watershed using in situ optical sensors. The successful completion of this research has the potential for transformative impact through the generation of new insight and data from both lab and field studies to advance the fundamental understanding of the fate and transport of PyOM in forested watersheds as climate change exacerbates the frequency and severity of wildfires.

In some special materials, such as superconducting and superfluid condensates, the fundamental particles interact with each other in such a way they move in lockstep, eliminating collisions and forming a new phase of matter that is of great importance to new technologies from lossless electricity transfer to quantum computing. It is possible to increase the complexity of such superfluid phases by confining them to very small regions of space so that the interaction of the superfluid with its confining boundary can lead to the emergence of surface phenomena which could be useful for engineering new phases of matter that are not observed in the bulk material. These new phases of matter have the potential to drive future quantum technologies.<br/><br/>In this project, the PI will work with graduate student researchers to develop theoretical and computational tools that will advance the fundamental understanding of the interaction of superconducting phases with their boundaries in confined geometries. The project will provide critical knowledge that will drive the discovery of new boundary-induced surface states in superconductors as well as the development of ways to tune these states to achieve desirable physical properties.

Engineers and scientists who are seeking to use light for quantum technologies require ?single-photon emitter? devices that produce just a single photon with a flip of a switch. Such devices, however, need single-photon emitting materials that are hard to come by because they also need to be compatible with modern semiconductor engineering and fabrication techniques. Recently, a new class of single-photon emitters was discovered in ultrathin two-dimensional materials and was greeted with much excitement because, among other advantages, two-dimensional materials can be more easily integrated into devices than most other single-photon emitting materials. However, the underlying material properties and physical phenomena that lead to the single-photon emission in two-dimensional materials remain unknown: it is known that single-photon emitters exist, but it is not known why. This project aims to answer this critical question by combining highly sophisticated optical microscopy techniques to study single-photon emitters in two-dimensional materials on ultrasmall length scales. The experimental studies are complemented by the development of theoretical models to better predict their behavior and identify ways to improve their performance for quantum technologies. These research activities include strong components of quantum-centered education and workforce training, including highly interdisciplinary Ph.D. research, integrated undergraduate research opportunities, curriculum development, and public and K-12 outreach activities.<br/><br/>Technical Summary<br/>Light-based quantum technologies necessitate quantum emitters to produce single photons or entangled photon pairs on demand. The discovery of single-photon emitters (SPEs) in monolayer WSe2 (1L-WSe2) ushered in a revolutionary class of solid-state quantum emitters with new opportunities for deterministic positioning, facile emitter control, and integrability into photonic architectures. However, the physical mechanisms giving rise to these promising states are still unknown, hindering their development. Using state-of-the-art theoretical modeling with advanced experimental characterization, a new mechanism of strain-induced exciton localization in 1L-WSe2 was previously identified. It upends the understanding of strain localization of excitons in two-dimensional semiconductors and may be the mechanism that underlies many SPEs in 1L-WSe2. With an overarching goal of developing an understanding of SPE phenomena in 1L-WSe2 that will guide their development into controllable quantum photonic devices, this project is focused on (1) investigating whether the newly discovered states are room-temperature SPEs; (2) establishing the roles of these states in known low-temperature SPEs; and (3) exploring new routes for engineering the creation and active control of SPEs in 1L-WSe2 and other two-dimensional materials. The research strategy combines nano-optical characterization with low-temperature quantum optical measurements and theory, and it is integrated with educational efforts emphasizing mentoring and hands-on learning about photonic materials, quantum optical characterization techniques, and the fundamentals of quantum information science for students in high school through graduate school.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is in the national economic and stratgic interest to ensure that US industry and workers regain leadership in collaborative manufacturing robots. Towards that goal, this project will develop understanding of technical and socio-technical requirements to accelerate the use of collaborative robotics.   The project will contribute new knowledge and theory of Human-Computer Interaction and Human-Robot Interaction, by augmenting human cognition for safer and more efficient collaborative robot interaction.  The new design principles for collaborative robotic technologies will improve both the worker and the employer's growth and progress. Fundamental knowledge gained here will be directly applicable in other high-risk domains that use collaborative robots, such as offshore oil rigs, military, and construction. The project seeks to empower new populations of workers (e.g., workers with disabilities), allow older workers to remain in the workforce, and potentially assist novice workers, thereby reducing skills gaps and improving work efficiency.  The team will focus on broadening the participation of females in computing.  In addition to traditional academic venues (e.g. conference, journals, etc.), research results will be further disseminated through workplace workshops and seminars through existing state, regional, and national networks of employers and industry partners. <br/><br/>To meet these goals, the team of researchers plan to: (1) develop a novel HRI task/scenario classification scheme in collaborative robotics environments that are vulnerable to system failures; (2) establish fundamental neurophysiological, cognitive, and socio-behavioral models (workload, cognitive load, fatigue/stress, affect, and trust) to monitor and model the mind motor machine nexus; (3) use these models to determine when and how a human's cognitive, social, behavioral and environmental states require adjustment via technology to enhance HRI for efficient and safe work performance; and finally (4) create an innovative and transformative Work 4.0 architecture (AMELIA: AugMEnted Learning InnovAtion) that includes a layer of augmented reality for human and robots to mutually learn and communicate current states.  The team will characterize worker cognitive states inferred from their physiological data and eye tracking. They will then use embedded sensor readings, error codes, and surveillance cameras to characterize robot states. Through augmented reality, AMELIA will provide this data to both the worker and the robot for effective real-time adjustment in behaviors to mitigate failure sources and errors while ensuring minimal additional cognitive load. The team plans a novel communication scheme using artificial emotional intelligence in which robots and humans collaborate in potentially dangerous situations. The robot will detect the worker's cognitive state using different machine learning techniques, and then take the appropriate action.  Ultimately AMELIA seeks to empower the worker to focus on complex, cognitive problem-solving tasks, performed safely and efficiently, while ensuring that it adapts to both the worker's attitudes and cognitive states.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project is concerned with understanding how the solutions to such equations behave. The Laplace equation is the prototypical elliptic PDE, and it is used to model steady-state homogeneous systems. This equation is studied in the fields of PDE, complex analysis, harmonic analysis, geometry, and engineering; and therefore, the behavior of its solutions (known as harmonic functions) is very well-understood. However, many questions remain regarding the behavior of solutions to more complicated equations like those that model quantum behavior, systems with microscopic structure, and systems that are changing in time. The investigator?s knowledge of harmonic functions will be used to answer these questions, thereby advancing knowledge in the areas of elliptic and parabolic partial differential equations. Motivated by the goal of increasing participation from underrepresented groups, as well as addressing common issues with retention in academia, this project integrates an inclusive workshop in PDE and harmonic analysis. The target workshop audience will include junior mathematicians who are at difficult transitional stages in their careers, especially those from historically underrepresented groups. Speakers will be chosen to reflect the demographics of the student participants and the potential for greater diversity in our discipline.<br/><br/>The Laplace equation is a PDE that models steady-state phenomena in a truly uniform environment. Since the world that we live in is not an isotropic vacuum, the mathematical equations that govern many natural phenomena are often more complicated than Laplace?s equation. For example, the Schrodinger equation describes the behavior of quantum-mechanical waves, while its generalizations describe even more complex settings. As such, there is a need to understand the properties of solutions to general elliptic PDEs. One component of this research project revolves around using known properties of harmonic functions to gain a better understanding of solutions to elliptic equations. Specifically, the investigator will explore how the presence of variable coefficients and lower-order terms affects the behavior of solutions to elliptic equations. This line of inquiry will be addressed through the perspectives of unique continuation and homogenization theory. Given that parabolic equations like the heat equation model the evolution of systems that are changing in time, it is also important to understand how the solutions to such PDE behave. Therefore, in another direction, the investigator will use elliptic theory to tackle problems related to parabolic PDE. More specifically, the investigator will construct a framework for using elliptic theory in high-dimensional settings to understand the properties of solutions to parabolic equations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At the heart of the program is a duality principle (a form of electric-magnetic duality in physics), which predicts surprising connections between a priori unrelated mathematical objects. Understanding the nature of this duality is a fundamental problem in mathematics and physics. Rather than study these phenomena in the traditional contexts of number fields or algebraic curves, the PI sets the Langlands program in the realm of 3-dimensional topology - a rich and active area of research in its own right. In this setting, these deep ideas become much more accessible than was previously possible. For example, one component of the project is about observing Langlands phenomena by comparing different ways to count knots in a given 3-dimensional space. Such methods open up the Langlands program to a wider mathematical world and provide pathways to involve a new generation of students in this fundamental research area. This project provides research and training opportunities for students.<br/> <br/>In more detail, the PI will define (mathematically) and study the space of states associated to a 3-manifold in the family of geometric Langlands topological quantum field theories of Kapustin and Witten. The proposed research is broadly in the realm of geometric representation theory, intersecting with concepts and tools from gauge theory, quantum topology (skein theory), and derived algebraic geometry. Some particular goals of the research include: formulating a duality conjecture for the dimensions of skein modules, as well as tools to explicitly verify in a number of important cases; a proof of the Betti and de Rham geometric Langlands conjecture for elliptic curves at generic level by developing an elliptic/quantum variant of generalized Springer theory; a refined construction of the state space of the B-model using tools from derived algebraic geometry; and a computation of the homology of gauge groups of 3-manifolds in terms of the Langlands dual spectral Whittaker theory.

The discovery of the BNS event GW190817 by LIGO and Virgo has demonstrated the immense scientific potential of studying tides in BNSs. This award will support research into investigating tidal interactions in BNSs based on first-principle theories and their implications for GW observations.

It has been suggested that incorporating nonlinear tides may enhance the agreement between analytical models and numerical relativity simulations based on tidal calculations at the Newtonian order. The calculations will be extended to post-Newtonian orders, resulting in readily applicable templates for GW data analysis and comparison with numerical relativity.

While quantum mechanics correctly predicts the behavior of small objects such as electrons and atoms, the application of quantum mechanics to larger objects has puzzled physicists for over 80 years. Most famously, applying the often strange predictions of quantum mechanics to the macroscopic objects we experience in daily life led the famous physicist Erwin Schroedinger to conclude that a cat could be placed in a state in which it is both dead and alive at the same time! In the present project, the investigators will test the predictions of quantum mechanics on a small sphere, approximately 1 micrometer across, which is 10,000 times larger than an atom but still 100 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair. To isolate the sphere, it will be levitated in a magnetic field in a sealed chamber with nearly all the air removed; less than one millionth of one millionth of atmospheric pressure will remain. Since nothing is allowed to directly touch the sphere, it will be pushed around using laser light. Ultimately, the behavior of the sphere under these conditions will increase our understanding of the limits of quantum mechanics, which makes much of modern life possible.<br/><br/>This goal of this project is to test the predictions of quantum mechanics on a mesoscopic object, a micrometer-scale sphere levitated in a magneto-gravitational trap. The project builds on the unique properties of a microsphere in a magneto-gravitational trap, including static trapping fields, stable trapping, extreme isolation from the environment in ultra-high vacuum,  high efficiency of optical detection of the particle position, and the precise control of the motion of the particle which is possible with feedback cooling via radiation pressure. While the motion of the particle is classical over long time scales (seconds), new sub-millisecond pulsed measurements with greatly increased optical intensity are predicted to reveal quantum-limited behavior when the radiation pressure shot noise due to the illumination dominates the motional state decoherence. In particular, the pulsed measurements are expected to enable position detection near the standard quantum limit. With continued improvements in isolation, the system will enable tests of gravitational collapse models such as continuous spontaneous localization and serve as a platform for future exploration of mesoscopic quantum mechanics and ultra-sensitive force measurements.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, much of the ability to define the type of risks posed by individual volcanoes relies on the challenging task of accurate interpretation of their eruptive products (e.g. pumice and ash), particularly crucial in systems that have not been historically active. This project aims to improve the ability to use eruptive products to interpret how large, explosive eruptions evolve over time. To accomplish this, the erupted products from the 1991 eruption of Mt. Pinatubo (Philippines) will be studied, one of the largest explosive eruptions observed in the 20th century. Through quantifying the timescales associated discrete phases of this eruption, the processes controlling the evolution of these violent events will be reconstructed. These results will be integrated into the dense seismic and visual records collected from Mt. Pinatubo, creating an unprecedented database for linking modern eruption monitoring data with a field-based approach typically used for interpreting historic deposits. In addition to these scientific impacts, this will support a woman who is a new NSF PI, and will support several graduate and undergraduate students. This project is jointly funded by Petrology & Geochemistry and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>Mt. Pinatubo experienced several days of discrete, smaller sub-plinian explosions, which ramped up to the June 15th climatic eruption. Reconstructing the decompression history through the Mt.

A quantitative record of magma decompression during the days of escalating activity will be obtained by measuring concentrations and gradients of volatiles (H2O, CO2, Cl, Li, F) preserved in reentrants (open melt pockets hosted in crystals) and coupling this information with microlite growth timescales. Through combining these methods with detailed sampling, an understanding for how long and where magma was stalled during breaks in explosive activity will be determined. Further information will come from decompression experiments, which will allow for testing all ascent-rate interpretations through simulations. This project involves collaborations with scientists at the United States Geological Survey, three universities within the U.S., and researchers in the Philippines. Ultimately, the dataset afforded by this project will allow us to ask whether one can see evidence for what ended up being an escalation in eruptive energy preserved within the erupted products.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This collaborative USA-UK project is focused on understanding how continued warming and increasing drought will combine to influence the composition and activity of stream and river organisms (i.e., bacteria, algae, and animals). At present, the prevailing view is that warming temperatures and drought will together produce more extreme ecological consequences than would result from either of these stressors alone. However, this project examines a contrary hypothesis that organisms and communities may ?adjust? to warming over long periods of time, making them much less susceptible to extreme drought events in the future. In essence, this project tests the hypothesis that stream communities compensate for continued warming and thus will be better able to persist and function in the face of increasing future drought. This research is critical for predicting and mitigating how warming and drought will influence freshwater biodiversity, as well the many important ecological processes in streams, such as nutrient removal and food production, that benefit humanity. This project will provide training, education and professional development opportunities to graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This project takes advantage of two unique research settings: (1) a natural stream thermal gradient in Iceland; and (2) a state-of-the-art experimental stream facility at the University of Birmingham, UK to test the degree to which long-term warming enhances stream ecosystem stability (both resistance and resilience) in response to drought events. The first objective, focused at the individual level, investigates whether physiological adaptations to warming can compensate for reduced invertebrate carbon use efficiencies at high temperatures, thus accelerating growth and energy transfer (i.e., resilience) following drought. The second objective quantifies resistance and resilience of entire invertebrate communities and their biomass production to drought across natural and experimental thermal gradients. The final objective explores the potential for ecosystem-level compensatory responses by examining how warming-induced shifts in primary producer communities and nutrient supply influence stability of ecosystem metabolism and nitrogen uptake in response to drought. Together, these objectives will provide a broader understanding of compensatory responses to warming across multiple levels of biological organization (i.e., individuals to ecosystems), and will help to inform management of freshwater ecosystems. <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Population and Community Ecology Cluster in the Division of Environmental Biology and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).

While opioid overdose deaths have increased greatly over the past two decades as compared to other chronic diseases (e.g., heart disease) the development of remote monitoring and management tools and techniques for opioid cravings, recovery, and relapse have not kept pace.  There is a critical need to design therapy programs that are discreet, accessible, connected, and personalized by supporting those recovering from Opioid Use Disorder (OUD), beyond conventional therapies. This project develops intelligent Pervasive Augmented reaLity therapies (iPAL) - a technology-enabled OUD intervention that aims to help OUD sufferers manage their cravings to reduce their risk for relapse or overdose. iPAL integrates complementary psychotherapies (cognitive behavioral therapy and heart rate variability biofeedback) with immersive technologies (augmented and mixed reality) to offer convenience, discretion in use, in the moment/real-time through personalized strategies. This work is poised to revolutionize how individuals learn, discover, create, and heal in the broader context of developing treatment strategies for those with OUD. The immediate benefit of the developed system will be iPAL, an appliance for helping those with OUD to experience a better quality of life. The proposed framework has translational potential beyond OUD: serving as a mental health support aid for those suffering from other forms of addiction (e.g., smoking and alcohol), suicidal ideation, post-traumatic stress disorder, and/or severe depression. This work is especially relevant to rural areas where people with OUD often have poor access to services. Even when services are available, stigma is a significant barrier to accessing these traditional addiction services.<br/><br/>The novel and potentially transformative nature of this project lies in transcending the foundational theoretical understanding and identification of key technological (e.g., augmented, mixed, and virtual reality), neurophysiological (e.g., functional brain activity, heart rate variability, electrodermal activity), and affective determinants (e.g., positive or negative valence and arousal) of immersion that predict OUD patient experience and subsequently intent (e.g., manage cravings).

Agricultural areas face a pervasive problem of poor water quality that is tied to inefficient use of fertilizer-provided nutrients by crops. Soils play a key role in regulating whether nutrients from fertilizers actually add value to the plant growth or if the nutrients are not absorbed and end up contaminating groundwaters and streams. The ability to understand how to promote the retention of nutrients in soils, reduce the potential for water resource contamination, and increase delivery of nutrients to crop production are collectively hampered by the inability to make direct observations of the activities of dissolved chemicals in soil water. This work will use new sensors embedded in soils to observe a suite of added nutrients, including the key nutrient and major water contaminant nitrate, over a range of experimental and field conditions. These buried sensors will transmit data electronically, and a soil model will be used to interpret the signals. The results of this work will identify conditions that balance water quality and sustainable plant production in model rain-irrigated systems of the Northern Great Plains. This project will also motivate activities supporting science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education and participation in underserved communities of the region. If successful, this project will strengthen the nation?s food security while preserving water resources by providing technology that makes the use of agricultural fertilizers more efficient and decreases the negative environmental impacts of these fertilizers.<br/><br/>The movement of water through soils mediates both weathering reactions and biogeochemical cycles to drive solute loads delivered to groundwater and rivers. However, current sensor technologies and solute transport modeling approaches limit the efficacy of efforts to address critical questions about soil processes governing the consequences of land use for water quality. In soils, the highly soluble and mobile nitrate ion provides an indicator of nitrogen (N) availability and transformation, serving as a frequently studied yet under-observed signal molecule in disturbed and fertilized systems. Nitrate concentrations in soils are currently quantified using destructive soil sampling, a technique used for over a century. In-situ and real-time measurements of nitrate concentrations in soil waters are lacking. Two limitations hamper understanding of the nitrate signal: 1) lack of high-frequency observations of soil solution composition, and 2) lack of observations that differentiate dynamics in nitrate concentrations driven by variation in the pore structure of the soil fabric. This work will develop, test, and produce a coupled multi-scale sensor approach and solute transport modeling framework capable of scaling reaction dynamics from pore to profile scales. The team will undertake measurements of nitrate in parallel with measurements of general water quality (conductivity, pH, temperature), to address how variation in soil water biogeochemistry associated with variation in pore structure dictates nitrate fate and transport in agricultural soils. Results will include the establishment of new technologies for exploring mechanisms interrelating physical soil structure, hydrologic dynamics, and solute reaction regimes from pores to profiles. These fundamental insights about soil systems will benefit efforts to balance water quality protection with sustainable food production.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many equity-related challenges in students' communities can be understood through the use of mathematics and specifically the use of mathematical modeling (the analysis of complex real-world situations using mathematical resources and tools). Supporting teachers to make use of mathematical modeling in the elementary classroom to advance issues of equity will require targeted teacher professional development (PD).  Advancing Equity and Strengthening Teaching with Elementary Mathematical Modeling is a teacher PD project focused on strengthening K-5 teaching with mathematics modeling. Building on previous foundational work around mathematics modeling and equity, this project will bring together equity oriented teaching practices and mathematical modeling to design and research the impact of a blended PD program on teacher practice. The project will include video-enhanced reflection and online mentoring in addition to face-to-face components of PD.  Using five pivotal spaces for elementary mathematics modeling as a framework, the project will explore the ways in which tools and structures that support practices aligned with pivotal spaces in mathematics modeling lessons can help teachers advance equitable participation and develop student competencies in mathematics modeling. The project will engage in cycles of design-based implementation research (DBIR) to study the relationships between features of the PD and changes in teacher practice, understandings, and dispositions.<br/><br/>The project will deploy a blended PD model that includes face-to-face sessions, coaching, and video-based reflection. Three DBIR cycles will be undertaken, starting with case study-based design cycles, focused PD cycles facilitated by project staff, and full-scale PD cycles facilitated by teacher leaders.  Sites in four states have been recruited that represent a wide range of contexts and student demographics. Six professional learning modules related to elementary math modeling will be created.  The project will use the lesson observation protocol known as M2C3-Scan to assess changes in teacher practice, conduct student pre and post assessments of mathematical modeling competencies for students in grades 3-5 and formative assessments of mathematical modeling competencies for all students, and assess beliefs and confidence of teachers teaching mathematical modeling.  The project team will also interview teachers, collect implementation logs, and use a teacher-annotated video reflection platform to analyze changes in classroom practice. Repeated measures analyses will be conducted on student learning data, with cycles of qualitative analyses related to understand changes in teacher practices, competencies, and beliefs.<br/><br/>The Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools.

LeCain, PI; Kirke D. Elsass, co-PI<br/><br/>Cement?the substance that binds together and solidifies concrete?is indispensable to building modern transportation, energy, and residential structures. Global production of cement contributes around eight percent of human-caused carbon dioxide emissions. Primarily for this reason, chemists and engineers around the world seek replacement materials and new building techniques that might reduce cement use. ?Cementing Spaces,? a historical study of cement and society, complements and informs the work of those material scientists who are rethinking concrete. The study accounts for cement as both an environmental element and a cultural element in the past. It introduces evidence that conventional cement affected the development of cultures in both subtle and profound ways. In short, cement created new spaces with which people created new cultures. Studying the cultures created with cement in the past provides a framework for industry researchers and public officials to consider and anticipate the many consequences to society that will ensue from their exploration and implementation of alternatives to cement.<br/><br/>?Cementing Spaces? focuses on the relative impermeability of cement. Cement?s potential to create environmental barriers, cultivated for control of water during the nineteenth-century canal era, proved to be an appealing and influential quality in a variety of ubiquitous twentieth-century structures. Case studies of home basements, public sidewalks, and prison cells will employ archived documents to deeply explore the ways cemented environments shaped new cultures of family, mobility, and incarceration. The project hypothesizes that cement, by separating people from water, dirt, or one another, had a role in turning cellars into modern basements, inviting new municipal codes and new footwear styles of urban life, and supporting carceral authorities? use of solitary confinement as a punitive measure. The findings of ?Cementing Spaces? will contribute to scholarship that reveals how nonhuman things participate in the development of societies, here with a novel focus on a material technology that despite its ubiquity is not popularly understood.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Intelligent morphology is the concept that natural structures have evolved to reduce the energetic and neurological inputs required to control them. Insects are masterful at exploiting intelligent morphology, utilizing their body's flexibility to interact effortlessly with their environments.   This enables them to perform complex tasks using a small fraction of the energy and cognitive power available to other animals. By contrast, many engineered systems continue to employ rigid components which relegate little function to passive mechanisms.  This limits their energy efficiency, increases controller complexity and reduces their capacity to adapt to dynamic environments.  Using the insect model, this project will generate methodologies that incorporate intelligent morphology design principles into engineered systems, which in turn can enhance their performance and durability.  Concurrently, this award will support the training of future engineers in the fields of dynamics and vibrations through a state-of-the-art Applied Dynamics educational laboratory.   The Applied Dynamics educational laboratory will also host annual week-long workshops focused on teaching the fundamentals of vibrations to rural middle school students who currently have limited access to science programs, as well as other students from underrepresented groups.  Current research topics will be integrated into these educational activities.  <br/><br/><br/>This program aims to develop a data driven system-level model of the insect flight mechanism that is comprised of the following components: the insect wing, abdomen, thorax, wing hinge and wing costal break.  The project focuses on the latter three.  Data collected from dynamical experiments on actual insects will drive component model formulation, and benchtop experimental systems representative of each component will be constructed in order to study biological phenomena in a controlled environment.  Through this integrative approach of analytical modeling, biological testing and benchtop experimentation, this research will demonstrate how (1) the flexible insect thorax minimizes the energetic costs of locomotion, (2) the wing hinge simplifies flight control, and (3) wing buckling enhances insect collision robustness.  Derived models will be reduced order to facilitate parametric studies and will account for complex phenomena associated with viscoelasticity and nonlinearity.   Such models can easily be extended to inform bio-inspired technologies such as flapping wing micro air vehicles and flapping airfoil energy harvesters.

Consequently, solutions to the Laplace equation, known as harmonic functions, are a fundamental component of PDE theory. But these functions are also important to many other areas of science and engineering, like complex analysis, harmonic analysis, geometry, physics, and engineering. As such, harmonic functions have been extensively studied and are well understood. While the Laplace equation models steady-state phenomena in a uniform environment, the world that we live in is not an isotropic vacuum. The mathematical equations that govern many natural phenomena like electromagnetism, astronomy, and fluid dynamics are often more complicated than Laplace?s equation. For example, the Schrodinger equation describes the behavior of quantum-mechanical waves, while its generalizations describe even more complex settings. Therefore, there is a need to understand the properties of solutions to such general elliptic PDEs. This project combines mathematical pursuits in harmonic analysis with the goal of promoting the inclusion and retention of a diverse mathematical community. The latter objective will be achieved through an orientation program for incoming graduate students along with extra-curricular mentorship programs.<br/><br/>In this project, the PI will explore how and to what extent the presence of lower-order terms and variable coefficients affects the behavior of solutions to elliptic equations. With the Schrodinger equation serving as the standard example, these effects will be examined through the three distinct perspectives of unique continuation, homogenization, and solvability. Harmonic functions have the following unique continuation properties: locally, they cannot vanish to infinite order; and if defined globally, Liouville?s Theorem asserts that they cannot be bounded everywhere. Motivated by Landis? conjecture, one facet of this program seeks to precisely quantify these kinds of local and global behaviors for solutions to generalized Schrodinger equations. By going further and considering elliptic equations with periodic coefficients, this program also explores the interplay between homogenization theory and unique continuation. Carleman estimates and complex analysis techniques will be combined with compactness arguments to accomplish this feat. Work on the solvability of the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary value problems for the Laplace equation led to a huge development in the theory of PDEs and harmonic analysis. The PI?s previous work will be used to explore the questions of solvability for general systems of elliptic PDEs with lower order terms, and further knowledge will be gained while bringing together ideas from distinct areas of mathematics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The work involves oceanographic sampling across a range of oxygen and nutrient levels in the Eastern Tropical North Pacific Ocean. Using a combination of genomic, microbiological, and biogeochemical methods, the study identifies the mechanisms by which SAR11 strains diversify into separate niches and species and contribute biochemically to the ecosystem, likely through removing nitrogen from seawater. The project equips the next generation of researchers and educators, notably those from underrepresented minority groups, to use oceanographic, genomic, and microbiological concepts to meet contemporary scientific challenges. This goal is met through a combination of bioinformatic workshops that target undergraduate students from the University System of Puerto Rico, middle school teacher-training workshops, and middle or high school teacher internships in the investigator?s labs. This multifaceted research and educational agenda fills a gap in our understanding of marine biological diversity, identifies the contribution of SAR11 bacteria to nutrient and carbon cycles in low oxygen oceans, and provides lessons and analytical tools to study microbial processes in other ecosystems.<br/><br/>This project has two aims. Aim 1 employs comparative metagenomic and single-cell genomic analyses to identify metabolic properties that distinguish SAR11 clades from low oxygen regions and processes of selection or gene flow operating across the clades. Aim 2 combines microbial transcriptomics, incubation experiments with isotope tracers, and culturing to delimit the oxygen and nutrient conditions that define the niche space of each SAR11 clade and to correlate SAR11 gene transcription with community biochemical outcomes, including nitrogen loss through denitrification. The results of these aims and the informatic methods used to probe microbial microdiversity are disseminated through genomics-focused undergraduate workshops, and new teacher-training educational modules, including lab-based modules focused on the importance of microorganisms under environmental change in the oceans. Data, manuscripts, and informatics workflows from this project are made publicly available. The results are critical for resolving the processes that create and sustain microbial diversity in the oceans and informing biogeochemical models that predict how diversity influences ecosystem processes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Hundreds of years later, gravity is still considered to be the most poorly understood force. It cannot be consistently described across different theories in physics, and even its strength is poorly known. The Newtonian constant of gravitation, which quantifies the strength of gravity, is perhaps the most poorly measured fundamental property of the universe. This project seeks to greatly improve our knowledge of this constant with the most significant change in technique since the experiments of Henry Cavendish in 1798, who used a torsion balance for his measurements. The measurement funded by this award may be of value across many areas of physics and astronomy, and the new experimental tools being developed may lead to new instruments for measuring extremely small forces and accelerations for use in studying the earth and for inertial navigation. Further, the attention to detail required in these experiments makes them an exceptional training ground for tomorrow's STEM workers.<br/><br/>The ultimate goal of this project is to develop a new system for measuring the Newtonian constant of gravitation G, and to make a measurement of G to unprecedented accuracy (10 parts per million or better). The approach leverages a recently-developed optomechanical system: a silica microsphere suspended in a magneto-gravitational trap under ultra-high vacuum. The mechanical oscillation of the microsphere will be used in the time-of-swing method to determine G from the change in oscillation frequency when field masses are brought near the trapped particle. The system has multiple features that make it nearly ideal for precision measurements, including an oscillation frequency that can be made less than 1 Hz, isolation from the surrounding environment, and other degrees of freedom to act as a built-in probe to correct for drifts. The proposed measurement strategy was chosen for its transparency to the scientific community. First, the simplicity of the system makes it simple to understand and analyze. Second, most of the data will be contained in sequences of images which are recorded; there are almost no hidden feedback loops or other difficulties in reanalyzing components. To ensure confidence in the new measurement, all data and analysis code will be stored and made freely available to other researchers in their entirety.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The LIGO and Virgo instruments have recorded almost 100 gravitational wave signals during the first three observing campaigns of the advanced detector era. This treasure trove of signals is providing unique insights into the astrophysical processes that lead to the formation of black hole and neutron star binaries. When the detectors resume operations in late 2022 or early 2023, new detections are expected be made on an almost daily basis. In addition to increasing the rate at which binary mergers are detected, the increased sensitivity of the instruments will improve the chances of detecting more exotic signals. The enhanced low frequency sensitivity will also mean that signals will be detectable for longer, which increases the chances that noise transients and fluctuations in the noise level will impact the signals. The goals of this project are threefold: significantly improve the processing speed to keep up with the deluge of events; develop new tools to detect and explore exotic signals; and develop new tools to account for noise transients and varying noise levels. The research projects described offer tremendous opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students: the blend of creative activities associated with the development of sophisticated and innovative data analysis techniques, combined with hands on exposure to running existing search pipelines and working with production level computer code will provide excellent training for the next generation of gravitational wave astronomers. These skills are transferable and highly sought after in other fields and in industry.<br/><br/>The most recent LIGO and Virgo observation campaign has emphasized the need for faster signal processing and more robust noise modeling. As the number of detections increases, we are starting to see more extreme systems that push the limits of the signal models used in the analyses. We are also seeing an ever increasing number of signals that were impacted by instrument noise transients (glitches). As the low frequency sensitivity of the detectors improves, the time that the signals are detectable will increase, which further increases the chances that noise transients and drifts in the noise floor will impact the analyses. The proposed research will develop new signal reconstruction techniques that can be used to detect and characterize exotic, un-modeled or poorly understood signals. This technique is especially well suited for detecting deviations from general relativity, and for extracting the post-merger signal from neutron star mergers. The post-merger signal can be used to reveal the interior composition of the merger remnant, and provide important insights into the behavior of matter at super-nuclear densities. Additionally, advanced noise modeling techniques will be deployed that can robustly model non-stationary and non-Gaussian noise. These advances will be combined with fast signal processing techniques that dramatically speed up the analyses, allowing for joint inference of gravitational wave signals, noise transients and non-stationary drifts in the noise floor in minutes, as opposed to the O3 analyses which took days or weeks for each event. Finally, a new algorithm for low latency glitch removal will be implemented that can safely clean the LIGO-Virgo data of noise transients. Real-time glitch removal will be especially important for longer duration signals, such as binary neutron star mergers, as the odds of encountering a glitch grow with the duration of the signal.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Past work has become a global model for population studies of large animals. Results have documented strong annual variation in reproduction, abundance, and population composition. This program will add components to evaluate the demographic role of immigrant mothers, evaluate possible drivers of annual variation in overall population dynamics, assess genetic differences between immigrant and locally born mothers, and document patterns of gene flow among seal colonies in the Ross Sea region. These new aspects will focus on understanding of population structure, function, and genetics and provide key information for predicting how the seal population will respond to environmental change. The addition of genetic approaches will advance available data for multiple groups in multiple countries working on Weddell Seals. This work includes an early career scientists training program for faculty university graduate and undergraduate students and well as a defined program for data sharing. The research is paired with active education and outreach programs, social media, websites, educational resources, videos and high-profile public lecture activities. The informal science education program will expand on the project?s successful efforts at producing and delivering short-form videos that have been viewed over 1.6 million times to date. In addition, the education program will add new topics such as learning about seals using genomics and how seals respond to a changing world to a multimedia-enhanced electronic book about the project?s long-term research on Weddell seals, which will be freely available to the public early in the project.<br/><br/>Part 2: Technical description <br/>Reliable predictions are needed for how populations of wild species, especially those at high latitudes, will respond to future environmental conditions.

Recent analyses of the study population indicate strong annual variation in reproduction, abundance, and population composition. The number of new immigrant mothers that join the population each year has recently grown such that most new mothers are now immigrants. Despite the growing number of immigrants, the demographic importance and geographic origins of immigrants are unknown. The research will (1) add new information on drivers of annual variation in immigrant numbers, (2) compare and combine information on the vital rates and demographic role of immigrant females and their offspring with that of locally born females, and (3) add genomic analyses that will quantify levels of genetic variation in and gene flow among the study population and other populations in the Ross Sea. The project will continue the long-term monitoring of the population at Erebus Bay and characterize population dynamics and the role of immigration using a combination of mark-recapture analyses, stochastic population modeling, and genomic analyses. The study will continue to provide detailed data on individual seals to other science teams, educate and mentor individuals in the next generation of ecologists, introduce two early-career, female scientists to Antarctic research, and add genomics approaches to the long-term population study of Erebus Bay Weddell seals.

The Himalayas began rising many millions of years ago when India collided with Asia, which changed Earth?s climate, altered ocean circulation and chemistry, and impacted the course of biological evolution. Erosion of the Himalayas resulted in deposition of the largest pile of sediment on the planet in the Bay of Bengal, the deep-sea Bengal Fan. Within this sediment record lies the history of the Himalayas ? the now eroded Mt. Everests of the past, buried under sediment of the continental shelf and the deepest parts of the Indian Ocean.  In 2015, a multi-national expedition on the JOIDES Resolution, a specially designed scientific drilling ship, recovered ~1.5 miles of sediment cores that contains this record. New research will use these sediments to trace the history of Himalayan erosion and how two of the world?s largest rivers, the Ganges and Brahmaputra, delivered it to the Bay of Bengal over the last 3-5 million years.  Giant mountain ranges like the Himalayas are a rarity through geologic history, but without the Himalayas there are no drenching Asian monsoons, no fertile floodplains or aquifers, no ancient Indus Civilization, and no Mt. Everests in that part of the world.  The results of this research will therefore tell us about climate change, landscape evolution, and how one of the world?s most densely populated areas came to be as seen today.  Understanding the past in this way can help us better understand the future for the 10% of the world?s population that lives under the influence of this incredible geographic feature.  This project also supports international collaboration between scientists and students from several universities in the U.S., the U.K. and several Asian countries where field work will be conducted.<br/><br/>The Himalaya-sourced Ganges-Brahmaputra river system and the deep-sea Bengal Fan represent Earth?s largest source-to-sink sediment-dispersal system.  IODP Expedition 354 drilled a 7-site transect in the middle Bengal Fan, almost 1000 miles from the modern Ganges-Brahmaputra delta shoreline, to expand the record of erosion and sediment routing from the Himalaya to the deep sea.  Previous research examined detrital-zircon (DZ) U-Pb data from sandy turbidites in IODP 354 core to summarize Miocene to middle Pleistocene patterns of sediment routing: this research identified major changes in specific DZ U-Pb age populations that correspond to the Plio-Pleistocene transition, and indicate major changes in provenance due to environmental forcing.  New research will build on earlier results and examine climatic and tectonic processes that drove this provenance change.  This research will be grounded on analyses of 25 new samples of Plio-Pleistocene sand from IODP 354 core, which represent sand transport to the Bengal Fan during glacial periods when sea level was low, as well as 60 new river sand samples from the modern Ganges-Brahmaputra drainage that will be used to establish patterns characteristic of the Holocene interglacial monsoon-dominated climate.  Detrital zircons and rutiles recovered from the sand fraction in these samples will be used as the primary signal carrier and will be analyzed for U-Pb geochronology, with zircons examined for (U-Th)/He thermochronology and Hafnium isotopes as well.

This project awarded to a CAREER scholar has the goal to examine the participation of LGBTQ students in undergraduate STEM programs to understand how their experiences as LGBTQ students in STEM affect their decision-making regarding STEM career goals. The research will provide STEM students, educators, administrators, and policymakers the tools to create LGBTQ-inclusive learning environments. This award is supported by the EHR Core Research program which supports fundamental STEM education research initiatives. <br/><br/>This study will achieve the research goal through three research aims. The first aim uses social network analysis to measure characteristics of LGBTQ STEM students' social networks, relate these characteristics to other STEM outcomes like STEM identity, and compare these characteristics with their heterosexual and cisgender peers. The second aim is to compare STEM degree completion rates between LGBTQ STEM students and their peers through regression analysis of a national dataset of college students. The third research aim is then to explore the discipline-based STEM identities of LGBTQ STEM students through narrative interviews. The research produced from this project will contribute by highlighting the potential consequences of hiding LGBTQ identity in STEM on students' social networks, the difference in STEM degree completion rates by sexual orientation and gender identity, and how the LGBTQ climate in STEM affects discipline-based STEM identities. The educational aims of the project are to develop a course on social network analysis in education research; create training resources for STEM faculty to ensure more LGBTQ-inclusive classrooms; and conduct training seminars on LGBTQ data for administrators and policymakers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Furthermore, N2O can destroy ozone, a gas responsible for protecting the earth from dangerous ultraviolet radiation. In the ocean, N2O production is largely controlled by the amount of available dissolved oxygen, with more N2O being produced under low oxygen concentrations; however, when no oxygen is available, a scenario referred to as anoxia, microbes in the ocean switch from producing N2O to consuming N2O. In recent years, it has become evident that zones of low oxygen are expanding in some areas of the oceans, and this has raised concern that more N2O will be produced. If this occurs, more N2O will be emitted to the atmosphere, and will lead to further global warming and ozone destruction. Because of this, research has largely focused on understanding how much N2O is produced in the ocean under low oxygen conditions. If, however, anoxic zones also increase in size, this could act to balance out, at least to some degree, the predicted increase in N2O production caused by the expansion of zones where oxygen is present but in low concentrations. This study aims to simultaneously measure N2O production and consumption, in both low oxygen and anoxic zones and identify the microbes responsible for N2O production and consumption. Our results will: 1) lead to a much better understanding of how N2O consumption in anoxic zones could help to balance out an increase in N2O production if low oxygen zones in the ocean continue to expand, 2) help to inform models aimed at predicting oceanic N2O production and emissions to the atmosphere under future ocean conditions, and 3) allow us to better understand the microbes involved in N2O production and consumption. Our study will support a postdoc and undergraduate students who will work at the interface of marine chemistry and community genomics. The PIs plan to specifically consider applications from underrepresented minorities and students at institutions with limited opportunities. The PIs also plan a number of other educational/outreach programs ranging from teacher-training workshops, teacher internships, and academic and public lecture series. <br/><br/><br/>The oceanic production of the potent greenhouse and ozone destroying gas nitrous oxide (N2O) increases as dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations transition from oxic to hypoxic. Marine DO concentrations have decreased globally with climate change and oceanic hypoxic zones have expanded and predicted to continue expanding. This increase is cause for concern that N2O production in the ocean will increase in the future which would lead to higher emissions to the atmosphere. As a result, much research has focused on quantifying the oxygen thresholds that correspond to large increases in N2O production. In contrast, relatively few studies have aimed to quantify the capacity for net N2O consumption, resulting from microbial N2O reduction to N2 under anoxic conditions, to buffer against predicted N2O production increases if anoxic zones expand in conjunction with hypoxic zones. To this end, this study aims to simultaneously quantify N2O production and consumption from oxic-hypoxic-anoxic water column zones, in order to determine the potential for N2O consumption to counteract predicted increases in N2O production. Our field work be conducted in Saanich Inlet, a British Columbian fjord which is an ideal natural laboratory for our study, as it is characterized by a well-established oxycline and anoxic zone. Specifically, we aim to 1) measure bulk N2O concentrations, and, using 15N tracer techniques, quantify N2O production and consumption rates as DO concentrations decrease from oxic to anoxic conditions, 2) quantify the magnitude by which N2O consumption in the anoxic zone balances increased N2O production in the overlying hypoxic region, and 3) definitively link observed N2O production and consumption rates to the microorganisms mediating this process, focusing specifically on distinguishing N2O consumption via denitrifier (NO3- to N2) versus non-denitrifier (N2O to N2 only) taxa. Ultimately, our results will provide quantitative information on N2O consumption rates over fluctuating ocean conditions, thereby helping constrain models of oxygen effects on net N2O production and ocean-to-atmosphere greenhouse gas fluxes. Furthermore, this work will identify the taxonomic breadth of microbes capable of N2O reduction and their linkage to actual N2O reduction rates, thereby providing a quantitative understanding of whether or not the detection of specific bio-signatures is predictive of marine N2O dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite the recent progress in protein sequencing and assembly, many of the currently available assembled proteins come in a draft form. There are still many gaps in the assembled protein sequences even if one combines top-down and bottom-up sequencing methods. In other words, at the end of the sequencing step for a specific protein, it is more likely to see contigs separated with gaps (which is called a scaffold). Hence, an important but also natural combinatorial problem is to fill the missing amino acids into a scaffold to obtain a complete protein sequence. With the new framework produced by this project, de novo protein sequencing will greatly advance the research and clinical practice of identifying the function and structure of proteins. The project will provide researchers with powerful computational tools for obtaining the sequence information of antibodies, which is extremely valuable for the construction of antibody databases. This interdisciplinary research also provides various training projects to students at all levels, particularly to underrepresented African American students, and helps them to pursue high quality research from an open-minded and cross-disciplinary perspective. New advances achieved will be integrated into undergraduate/graduate curricula. The results will be disseminated through journal publications, conferences, open-source software release, tutorials, and seminar talks.<br/><br/>In this project, the investigators will study the mass spectrometry-based de novo protein scaffold filling problem by two related phases. Firstly, the investigators will analyze the top-down and bottom-up tandem mass spectrometry to construct the protein scaffold without a proper reference. The methods include general global optimization, dynamic programming, and graph algorithms, which can also handle small protein mutations (where the mass of some amino acid changes). Secondly, the investigators will use deep learning methods, such as combined convolutional neural network and long short-term memory, convolutional denoising autoencoder, and transformer models to finish the last step of protein sequencing obtained by top-down and bottom-up tandem mass spectrometry analysis at first step. The project will result in a new framework of combined combinatorial and deep learning methods for protein scaffold filling, and a corresponding open-source software.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Collagen is a key structural protein in living organisms.  It is essential to the function of soft tissues and load-bearing organs. Collagen is sensitive to mechanical loads.  Even microscopic damage can significantly undermine health or lead to disease. For example, the commercial collagen market will soon exceed $6B annually as people seek supplements and treatments for anti-aging and health of joints, skin, bone, and muscle. The ability to reconstruct native collagen or to engineer collagen with functional specifications would fulfill unmet needs across a range of applications. Demand is enormous, but the knowledge required to meet it remains limited. Our objective is to determine, for the first time, how mechanical loading prompts cells to produce the building blocks of collagen (precursors) as well as to produce collagen itself. The project will provide fundamental new insight into how cells convert mechanical stimuli into biological responses. This new knowledge will advance production of collagen and transform tissue engineering, providing practical design principles for using mechanical loading (e.g. compression) to drive the production of collagen in a laboratory setting. This work will enable novel therapies for collagen-related morbidities and advance clinical treatment for patients with soft-tissue injuries, disease, and deformities, thus advancing the national health.  A comprehensive outreach plan will disseminate results to both scientists and to the general public.<br/><br/>The objectives of this project are to (1) establish the roles of mechanical strains and stresses in driving metabolic production of the amino acid precursors that precede production of collagen and (2) establish and validate design principles for load-induced production of collagen to unlock fundamental understanding and functional tissue engineering. The application of precise, cyclic mechanical loadings to cell-seeded agarose specimens will achieve homogeneous stimulation from distinct principal strains, and separately, stresses. Combining these experiments with metabolomic flux and statistical analyses will establish relationships between principal strains and production of precursors. Computational modeling will establish relationships between principal stresses and metabolomic responses. This work will measure production of type VI collagen under different applied strains/stresses to quantify and validate design principles that enable the in vitro synthesis of collagen with specified mechanical properties. The significance of this knowledge is twofold: it will (1) contribute original, foundational knowledge on the relationships between mechanical stimuli and collagen production; and (2) provide tools for tissue engineers to produce advanced cell-based materials for functional replication of soft tissues. By establishing how specific stresses and strains drive mechanotransduction, this work will transform a range of fields and translational applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This innovation catalyzes opportunities for open information exchange that will broaden healthcare providers? knowledge of drug testing safety and improve clinical care outcomes. Through the integration of trial safety information (drug interactions with standard of care treatments, side effect profiles, research team contact information) and related increase in trial participant retention, this product will accelerate the scientific understanding needed to develop novel therapeutics while positively altering the pharmaceutical industry research paradigm related to equitable, inclusive, and accessible safety management.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Role-playing scenarios relevant to industrial, research, and academic careers will be implemented, and Writing Center tutors will provide technical writing support to students. In order to make clear the relationship between writing self-efficacy and technical communication skills before and after the intervention, surveys will be given to the students and analyzed for correlations. The results of this project have the potential to be applied in laboratory courses across many disciplines and levels of undergraduate curriculum.

During June 2022, a 500-yr flood event swept across YNP and gateway communities destroying road and building infrastructures, leading to the closure of the park and the evacuation of more than 10,000 visitors. YNP remained fully closed for 9 days and subsequently reopened partially under variable entry systems; however, the northern entrances have remained closed, disconnecting gateway communities and crippling dependent economies. The economic impacts from the YNP closures on the region?s eco-tourism industry is expected to be severe in the following years. The Yellowstone flood experience runs counter to conventional disaster risk paradigms, which focus on the exposure, vulnerability, and resilience of the ?built-up environment?, such as risks to human health, property damages, or critical infrastructures. In contrast, the Yellowstone flooding suggests that an extreme disturbance in a national park, or natural infrastructure, can induce severe and systemic economic impacts to entire regions. This suggests that natural infrastructures can operate similarly to human-built infrastructures in providing critical services for human livelihoods. Ultimately, this brings into question how society should manage and value protected land assets and extends society?s valuation of US National Parks, ?America?s Best Idea?, beyond mere aesthetics to an accurate portrayal of serving critical roles in preserving our nation?s economic and public health security and safety. This Rapid Response Research (RAPID) project seeks to monitor and understand the infrastructural and economic impacts and recovery, as they rapidly unfold over the next weeks and months to understand the interdependencies between humans and natural infrastructures, particularly exposing society?s vulnerability to disasters in non-built-up areas. <br/><br/>The objective of the work is to rapidly collect ephemeral information critical to documenting and understanding the infrastructural impacts of the YNP flooding, the rate and nature of infrastructure evolution and recovery, and the systemic economic impacts of the flooding on the ecotourism-dependent industries in the gateway communities. Comprehensive inventories of infrastructure loss, damage, and recovery will occur via direct observation and photo documentation. Through interviews and web surveillance, the impacts of the closures and re-openings on economics, regional travel, and human activities will be documented. Finally, the FEWSION for Community Resilience (F4R?) program will identify social and physical infrastructures embedded within the region?s critical supply chains and provide communities with approaches to mitigate future disaster risks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These mountain ranges and neighboring basins (such as the Sierra Nevada and Great Valley basin within California) are conventionally interpreted to have formed due to eastward subduction of an oceanic plate beneath the western margin of the North American continent. Recent studies challenge this model and propose that much of the western Cordillera formed as an archipelago above westward subduction of an oceanic plate far from the margin of North America. In this alternative model, the archipelago became part of the Cordillera when the North American continent collided with the archipelago. This continental-scale study will test these models along four east-west transects across the western Cordillera in central Alaska, SE Alaska, British Columbia, and California. The project will provide support for four PIs, two of whom are female, the PhD work of three graduate students, and each PI?s commitment to provide undergraduate students with authentic field and laboratory experiences. The research methods are ideal for training undergraduate students to think across a range of spatial and temporal scales in the context of field observations and quantitative analyses, and undergraduate students will benefit from near-peer mentoring by graduate students. The researchers will also lead a multi-day field trip for Native American students centered on the connections between geologic processes that formed western North America and the homelands of Indigenous communities. <br/><br/>The research addresses the fundamental problem of determining subduction polarity along ancient convergent margins. This project will couple the study of mlange belts with basin strata, and integrate the results along the hypothesized continental-scale suture within the North American Cordillera. This collaborative project will evaluate 1) the age and provenance of mlange belts, 2) the basins? structural and sedimentological configuration (including inboard and outboard contacts), 3) the timing of basin formation and subsequent collapse, and 4) basin and mlange provenance comparison in the context of east-dipping versus west-dipping subduction.  Analysis of the basin strata and adjacent mlange belts using detrital zircon analysis (U-Pb, Lu-Hf, and trace element geochemistry), sandstone petrography, and whole-rock Sm-Nd isotopic analysis and trace-element geochemistry will provide a continental-scale test of proposed models to better understand the Mesozoic development of the North American Cordillera. This project will also refine methods for establishing the geometry and timing of convergent margin systems in other orogens, particularly pre-Mesozoic systems for which tomographic information is not available.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet evidence suggests that the reverse may also be true: the activity of stream insects in stream beds may help regulate water quality in streams in surprising ways. This award will document how stream insects alter the exchange of water between stream channels and underlying gravels of the streambed.  This exchange can transport pollutants from the stream channel into the streambed.  In the streambed, microbes break down the pollutants, providing a natural mechanism to remove pollutants from streams.  Thus, these stream insects may alter these important water exchange rates while also providing new habitat for microbes.  Researchers will investigate the ways in which stream insects may play in controlling processes that naturally cleanse rivers of pollutants and thereby facilitate the maintenance of high water quality in streams. Students from elementary through postgraduate will be trained and a video produced to highlight the importance of stream insects in the water quality of streams.<br/><br/>Specifically, researchers will investigate how caddisfly activity in the streambed alters river and stream biogeochemical cycling by: (i) regulating streambed hydraulic conductivity, hydrologic exchange, and resultant nutrient processing, and (ii) influencing microbial metabolism and associated nutrient processing by altering habitat conditions and niche opportunities for streambed microbial biofilms. The project will use a suite of laboratory flume experiments and field enclosure experiments to quantify the impacts of caddisfly silk nets and retreats on hydraulic conductivity and streambed residence time distribution for water, as well as documenting how silk nets and retreats alter streambed microbial habitats and associated expression of metabolic pathways.  Researchers will then integrate experimental results into a stream ecosystem model to understand the relative contribution of caddisfly-driven changes to hydrology versus changes to microbial communities in regulating whole-stream respiration and nutrient processing at the river reach scale. This study will be the first to: (i) quantify how macroinvertebrates (in this case, caddisflies) alter streambed hydrology in gravel-bedded rivers and streams, (ii) quantify how macroinvertebrate ecosystem engineers can influence microbial communities and their metabolic pathways, and (iii) develop a novel modeling approach to predict nutrient uptake under scenarios for animal-altered hydrology and microbial activity. The results from these studies will identify new biological considerations to be incorporated into theoretical and empirical models of river water flow dynamics and ecosystem functioning by bridging the disciplines of ecosystem ecology, aquatic entomology, and hydrology. Public outreach via a video and education will spanning elementary to postgraduate will highlight the importance of macroinvertebrates in altering hydrology, biogeochemistry, and metabolism of streams.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

TGFs are extraordinarily powerful bursts of gamma radiation; gamma-rays are particles of invisible light, similar to x-rays but in this case with energies up to about 100 times higher than the x-rays used by doctors and dentists. Although TGFs are rare, the consequences of a direct hit by one of these flashes to a plane full of people are significant. The crew and passengers could receive a very high, sudden dose of dangerous radiation, possibly enough to cause immediate radiation sickness and a significant risk of cancer later in life.  An unsolved and interesting problem in atmospheric physics regarding to TGFs is how, why, and when TGFs are produced. The research team seeks understanding of how the gamma-rays get as bright as they do and why (fortunately) they only happen in maybe one out of a thousand lightning flashes based on their current understanding of the ``building blocks'' of a TGF and how high-energy radiation might naturally happen during lightning. The investigation will potentially enable the team to predict involvement of TGFs in lightning flashes that interact with aircraft and provide valuable information on aviation risks for public safety. <br/><br/>In this project, the research team will deploy a number of gamma-ray detectors (previously constructed under funding from NSF, NASA, and the Air Force) to ground-based sites, aircraft, and high-altitude balloons in order to gather new data on TGFs in places they have been seen before, such as the western coast of Japan in winter, summer thunderstorms in Florida, and the eyewalls of hurricanes.  Each site and the method of observation have been chosen for measurements of TGFs close to their production locations. One of the key observations will be how bright TGFs can get and how faint they get. Currently temporal variations of TGF radiation intensity predicted by leading models have significant uncertainty. To address this uncertainty with consideration of a possible series of rapid bursts of radiation intensity with time, the fast response detector of plastic scintillators for observing each gamma-ray interaction will be used to determine the correct model physics. Combining measurements of lightning characteristics (mostly via radio emission) with complementary meteorological data, the team would be able to understand not only the detailed behavior of lightning that produces TGFs, but also lightning data of similar high quality for situations where a TGF did not get produced, which is equally important to understand.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Over 40 percent of women and 25 percent of men over 60 will experience a fragility fracture. The purpose of this research is to improve our understanding of the origins of bone toughness and to test if the loss of bone toughness is explained by the health of bone cells called osteocytes. Osteocytes are strain-sensing cells embedded in bone.  These cells are interconnected by an expansive porous network. Osteocytes can remove and replace (that is, remodel) bone tissue surrounding this expansive network.  Therefore, osteocytes may have an important but overlooked role in maintaining bone quality, specifically toughness. Because osteocyte health declines in aging and disease, it is important to understand whether interrupting osteocyte health decreases bone toughness. This project will advance the understanding of how, where, and why the osteocyte remodels bone and the impacts of osteocyte bone remodeling on bone toughness. The investigators will recruit and train underrepresented graduate and undergraduate students in the completion of the work. This work will also involve underrepresented undergraduate and high school students in the research and will engage K-12 students and teachers in bone biomechanics and materials science outreach activities. <br/><br/><br/>This project partners several novel approaches to investigate the impacts of osteocyte lacunar-canalicular remodeling on bone quality and fracture toughness. First, finite element modeling, histology, and histomorphometry will be used to assess the fraction of osteocytes that are remodeling bone tissue and evaluate whether osteocyte bone remodeling is related to bone tissue strain. Second, Auger electron spectroscopy will be used to produce submicron-resolution maps of bone mineral and matrix composition near osteocyte lacunae. Contact resonance atomic force microscopy maps will deliver an assessment of how bone energy dissipation, which determines bone fracture toughness, varies at the submicrometer-scale. Third, a high dietary fat diet will be used as a novel platform to study how lacunar-canicular remodeling affects bone fracture toughness. These models exploit the detrimental effect of fat on osteocyte health to modulate lacunar-canicular remodeling activities. The key outcomes of the project are (1) the number and location of remodeling osteocytes and determination of whether lacunar-canicular remodeling is related to bone tissue strain, (2) bone composition and mechanical properties at a physiologically-relevant resolution near remodeling and non-remodeling osteocytes, and (3) determination of whether lacunar-canicular remodeling beneficially impacts bone fracture toughness.

Economically valuable crops such as tomatoes, chilies, and eggplant rely for reproduction on native bee populations performing a behavior called buzz pollination, in which a bee lands on a flower stamen (male reproductive organ) and rapidly vibrates it to release its pollen. This pollen is collected on the bee?s abdomen and may be transferred to the pistil (female reproductive organ) of another flower as the bee continues to forage. While buzz pollination is critical to food security, the mechanical processes by which pollen are released by the flower are poorly understood. This knowledge gap stands in the way of the development of new technologies that may supplement natural pollinators in agricultural settings. In this project, this challenge is overcome by a systematic development of high-fidelity, data-driven models of the structural mechanics of deformable stamens and the dynamics of pollen expulsion using physical experiments and advanced computational analysis. Concurrent development of buzz pollination workshops, video, and other resources for the public will increase the accessibility of this research.<br/><br/>This research aims to quantify the structural deformation response of floral stamens under dynamic loads induced by a bee and the subsequent expulsion of pollen due to stamen vibrations and induced aerodynamic flows. This project will provide critical insight into how the vibratory forces imparted by buzz-pollinating bees are optimized to maximize pollen release.  First, experimental studies will be conducted to quantify the forces imparted by buzz-pollinating bees and to measure how floral stamens respond to such forces. Finite-element models of stamens will then be created and refined such that they accurately predict previously measured dynamic responses. Finally, computational models of pollen expulsion will be developed using the discrete-element method and moving boundary conditions prescribed from finite element modeling of the stamen. These pollen expulsion models will consider particle kinetics, adhesion, friction, and viscous aerodynamics. Pollen particle parameters will be identified via a combination of atomic force and optical microscopy. Parametric studies will reveal which physical phenomena are most critical to pollen expulsion.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will include training for students and a postdoctoral research and collaboration with Yellowstone National Park to develop educational materials for public audiences.<br/><br/>The study has three major objectives that focus on the sedimentary analysis of small lakes within and near the Yellowstone?s Lower Geyser Basin:  (1) develop a millennial-scale history of hydrothermal activity in Yellowstone for the first time activity (from lithology, geochemistry and diatoms); (2) evaluate the relationship between climate change?occurring over multiple timescales?and past hydrothermal activity, specifically investigating the hypothesis that hydrothermal systems are sensitive to periods of drought (from stable isotopic records and paleoclimate model simulations); and (3) examine the ecological consequences of past hydrothermal activity in a setting where hydrothermal landscapes create unique vegetation communities at present (from pollen, plant macrofossils and charcoal). Unraveling these connections will increase our understanding of past geo-ecosystem interactions in hydrothermal settings in Yellowstone and around the world and help build a framework for evaluating the paleobiological consequences of volcanic-driven events in deep time.

It is well known that student difficulties in STEM courses such as electric circuit analysis and engineering statics often arise from an inability of the student to accurately identify their knowledge gaps and to develop and follow strategies to close these gaps. This process is a means of exhibiting advanced metacognitive skill. The project will implement a novel writing-centric approach in an introductory circuit analysis undergraduate course to help students build mental models, overcome misconceptions, and enhance metacognitive skill. The introductory circuit analysis course will require students to utilize accurate mental models of abstract phenomena in the physical world. Students often enter such courses with faulty mental models of abstract phenomena. As such, conceptual change is necessary for content mastery.<br/><br/>The project will develop a deeper understanding of how to design short-answer writing exercises that require the student to consider problems in which misconceptions are common. Promoting deep reflection and providing instantaneous and personalized feedback, the writing exercises will be evaluated for their ability to enable both conceptual change and metacognitive skill development. The fact that the feedback is to be both immediate and individualized is particularly notable as feedback is known to be most effective when it is timely and targets the precise interpretation of a given student. To achieve an instantaneous and personalized feedback system that works at-scale, the writing exercises will be implemented as web-based applications that leverage recent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP). To ensure the software developed in this project is broadly applicable, instructors from multiple disciplines across the country will use the web-based templates developed by the research team to implement conceptual-based writing exercises in their foundational STEM courses. In addition to contributing to a deeper understanding of how to best employ short answer writing in STEM foundational courses as well as increasing retention in such courses, this project will train undergraduate and graduate students in implementing software systems made possible with algorithms employing artificial intelligence.

Biological armors and carapaces employ suture joints, which are wavy, compliant interlayers that connect rigid material domains, and these sutures can manifest at length scales ranging from a few nanometers to millimeters in size. It is generally assumed that suture joints amplify the strength and toughness of biological composites in the presence of complex loading conditions, but the underlying mechanisms are not understood. Recent advancements in processing and characterization of material structure at requisite length scales will enable this project to provide the first systematic experimental investigation and theoretical modeling of suture mechanics. This new knowledge could provide the basis for a new additive manufacturing paradigm for printing polymer composites with improved performance. Education and outreach programs will be developed to engage kindergarten to graduate students, exposing them to engaging concepts in mechanics and materials science. Activities include course development, undergraduate student research, outreach lessons, and a Rocky Mountain Mechanics Symposium.<br/><br/>The specific goal of the project is to establish structure-property relationships between suture geometry and three key stages of composite failure: crack nucleation, crack trapping, and mechanical interlocking. This project will seek answers to the questions such as: which structural suture parameters promote or inhibit each of the three stages, and how can parameters be balanced to amplify composite strength and toughness, and increase service life? More specifically, the research objectives of this project include: (i) understanding single-suture mechanics in thin films; (ii) understanding suture-suture interactions in thin films, (iii) establishing a two-wavelength additive manufacturing platform to extrapolate knowledge from thin films to 3D architectures where performance in the presence of bending, torsion, and compressive loadings can be studied. In pursuit of these objectives, two-stage reactive polymers will be employed to fabricate composites comprised of sutures with varying wavelength, amplitude, line width, and interlocking angles; atomic force microscopy will be used in fast force mapping mode to characterize variations in suture properties with nanometer resolution; finite element modeling will be leveraged to relate suture geometry to bulk composite performance.

In this project they will analyze and store genetic information from microorganisms (both archaea and bacteria) that prefer high temperature environments (thermophiles). Many of these organisms have only recently been discovered and their placement in the Tree of Life is not yet clear. This work is important because it will establish genetic relationships among different thermophiles that can be used to infer which of these lineages may have given rise to more complex (multicellular) organisms. In addition, the energic capabilities of these organisms, that do not require sunlight, can provide clues to how some of the first life forms may have used energy from chemical compounds such as sulfide, hydrogen and/or methane. The work will also result in an exhibit within YNP, focused on microbe-mineral interactions in a highly visible hot spring channel containing iron oxide terraces, which will be seen by as many as 0.5 million tourists annually.<br/><br/>This synthesis project will utilize data on genomics and metabolic activity of deeply rooted thermophiles to understand their phylogenetic position and metabolic importance in the Tree of Life.

This is due to the challenges of having adequate data on the survival and reproductive outcomes for numerous offspring born in diverse environmental conditions to mothers with known and diverse sets of traits.  This research project will evaluate the survival and reproductive consequences of early-life environmental conditions and variation in offspring traits that are related to maternal attributes (e.g. birth date, birth mass, weaning mass, and swimming behavior) in a population of individually marked Weddell seals in the Ross Sea. Results will allow an evaluation of the importance of different types of individuals to the Weddell Seal's population sustenance and better assessments of factors contributing to the population dynamics in the past and into the future. The project allows for documentation of specific individual seal's unique histories and provisioning of such information to the broader science community that seeks to study these seals, educating graduate and undergraduate ecology students, producing science-outreach videos, and developing a multi-media iBook regarding the project's science activities, goals and outcomes. <br/><br/>The research has the broad objective of evaluating the importance of diverse sources of variation in pup characteristics to survival and reproduction. The study will (1) record birth dates, body mass metrics, and time spent in the water for multiple cohorts of pups (born to known-age mothers) in years with different environmental conditions; (2) mark all pups born in the greater Erebus Bay study area and conduct repeated surveys to monitor fates of these pups through the age of first reproduction; and (3) use analyses specifically designed for data on animals that are individually marked and resighted each year to evaluate hypotheses about how variation in birth dates, pup mass, time spent in the water by pups, and environmental conditions relate to variation in early-life survival and recruitment for those pups. The research will also allow the documentation of the population status that will contribute to the unique long-term database for the local population that dates back to 1978."

By investigating the potential impact of concept mapping on students' ability to communicate technical information, this research aims to address the challenges of teaching technical communication to engineers. This project will also explore potential disparities among students and strive to create an inclusive learning environment that empowers students to have confidence in their technical communications. The principal investigator will be mentored by an experienced researcher in engineering education throughout the project.  The potential benefits of this project serve the national interest for well-prepared engineering graduates with technical communication skills to join the technical workforce and expanded capacity to conduct research on engineering education. <br/><br/>Concept mapping will be implemented as a tool to support students to learn how to communicate complex technical concepts in written reports. The research questions that will be explored are: 1) How does the use of concept mapping influence students' technical communication skills in the laboratory course?, 2) What are the the impacts of concept mapping on the technical communication skills for different groups of students? 3) To what extent does the collaborative development of concept maps impact individuals' communication skills and their respective performance on communication assignments?, and 4) What is the relationship between the quality of concept maps and scores on technical communication assignments? To answer these questions, data will be collected through surveys, interviews, and assessments, which will then be analyzed for evidence of growth in technical communication skills and confidence. The findings of this project seek to contribute to the advancement of technical communication instruction, promote deeper learning and understanding, and ultimately enhance the preparation of engineering graduates.

This project will use the database to address two important science questions regarding asteroids and pulsating stars. There are many asteroids in our solar system, some of which are nearby and could potentially impact the earth. Astronomers have been trying to catalog most of them over the last couple of decades. The NSC can help with this effort as it is able to detect fainter asteroids than most current searches and covers parts of the sky not previously explored. Large scale structures in our Milky Way galaxy can be mapped and explored by finding certain types of pulsating stars for which distances can be accurately determined from previous studies.  The project includes a plan to involve tens of thousands of citizen scientists to assist in various aspects of the project notably to find stars that have change position on the sky.<br/><br/>New techniques are needed to extract important scientific information and insights from both existing data sets and future large data such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) at the Rubin Observatory.

The first of these is to search for high proper motion objects, especially Near-Earth Objects that could potentially impact the earth. Modern clustering algorithms such as Spectral Clustering and DBSCAN will be utilized to process the 68 billion measurements and provide a census of nearby objects.

Topological data analysis (TDA) captures the 'shape' of data with descriptors (e.g., persistence diagrams and Reeb graphs).  Individually, these topological descriptors have proven to be powerful data-analysis tools; however, a single topological descriptor is often not rich enough to capture the intricacies of large, complex data that arises in real applications.  For that reason, this project develops a framework for studying topological spaces and data by transforming them into families of descriptors that capture the topology of different 'views' of the data.  Studying this family of descriptors enables new methods for summarizing and comparing topological spaces, and creates a pathway for their use in statistical settings.  As a result, this project will develop usable, theoretically-grounded data-analysis techniques that will enable TDA for large complex data, including networks, images, and point clouds.  Through the research activities, the investigator will train graduate and undergraduate students in interdisciplinary research, and special efforts will be made to recruit first-generation and underrepresented minority students.  The proposed educational activities will promote a sense of belonging of first-generation and underrepresented minority students as graduate students in STEM, and, more generally, as future academics in interdisciplinary domains.<br/><br/>More specifically, this project builds the foundations for representing and comparing large, complex topological spaces and data sets through parameterized families of topological descriptors, where a topological descriptor is any summary of a topological space.  These families of topological descriptors are called topological transforms.   The two objectives to accomplish this are: (1) Studying topological transforms and quantifying their ability to represent topological spaces.  The project team will study existing transforms, reframe other topological and data analysis concepts as a topological transform, and propose new transforms.  By allowing a diverse set of topological descriptors (from persistence diagrams to Euler characteristic curves to small graphs) and a choice of parameterization set (e.g., subspaces or ambient directions), the topological transform framework is flexible.  (2) Developing the statistical tools necessary for using topological transforms for data summarization and comparison.  In doing so, the project team will define distances between transforms and study the transforms as distributions over spaces of topological descriptors.  Throughout, theoretical developments will be grounded in applications, thus establishing mathematical foundations and algorithmic developments that address core issues in analyzing data from real-world applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Bacteria are able to exquisitely fine-tune their growth rate to their environment, responding  efficiently to sudden environmental changes. Abundance of ribosomes in a cell correlates tightly with the growth rate, and growth rate is controlled by the abundance of ribosomes that translate mRNA into protein. This biopolymerization process is influenced by an interconnected web of both direct and indirect feedbacks that depend on both transcription of genes and translation of ribosomal mRNA. Transcription and translation rates play a key role in response time of the microbe to changing conditions. This research seeks to develop a comprehensive mathematical model to describe ribosome assembly and abundance control in bacteria. The project emphasizes the integration of a broad knowledge of molecular biology, principles of physics, mathematical modeling and sensitivity analysis of a complex biological system.  Both undergraduate and graduate students will be trained to use tools from mathematics and physics within the broad field of systems biology, thereby contributing mathematicians with interdisciplinary skills towards the national goal of STEM workforce development.<br/> <br/>A new continuum model will have the flexibility to describe three biopolymerization processes: transcription of ribosomal RNA, transcription of mRNA of ribosomal proteins and the translation of ribosomal proteins. The model for each process is referred to as an individual compartment within the full assembly model.  The prototypical compartment is a generalization of vehicular motion models, and it provides a mechanism for including inflow and outflow phenomena as well as torque-assisted transcription when appropriate.  The full ribosome assembly model is described by a system of ordinary differential equations whose variables are related to the outputs of the individual compartments. The full model also includes a set of feedbacks that regulate initiation and translocation rates governing the dynamics occurring within each compartment. Ribosome production rate is the key determinant of bacterial growth rate, and it depends on several fundamental quantities including the response time after a nutritional up-shift or down-shift, the combined time of transcription and translation, and the time to produce a ribosome. Several system parameters exhibit inherent uncertainties due to the stochastic nature of availability of various enzymes. The project includes a sensitivity analysis effort to quantify effects of the most crucial system parameters on each fundamental quantity. Examining these effects and their variability  allows one to determine the average community response of bacteria to its environment. The variability in microbial community response to antibiotic application is often an important determinant of antibiotic effectiveness.<br/><br/>This award is funded jointly by the MPS Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS) through the Mathematical Biology Program and BIO/MCB through the Program of Genetic Mechanisms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Radiation tolerance of electronic components is their ability to shield themselves from the radiation in their working environments. A single charged particle can knock thousands of electrons loose, causing electronic noise and signal spikes. In the case of digital circuits, this can cause results that are inaccurate or unintelligible. The goal for the proposed technology is to achieve the necessary levels of space computing technology reliability in the presence of radiation at a fraction of the cost of existing systems.  The proposed technology is suitable for command and data handling tasks for small spacecraft that require lower performance but desire fault-tolerance.  Modifications may be made to increase its performance by adding hardware accelerators.  This higher performance version may be suitable for military and defense applications.  The inclusion of malware mitigation may make the proposed technology applicable to critical infrastructure applications such as in the nation?s electrical grid, water treatment plants, and hospitals. Providing more reliable computers in these systems may lead to a more resilient infrastructure that will not fail when under stress.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a computer that is able to continue foreground operation in the presence of radiation-induced faults and repair faulted circuity in the background.  The proposed technology takes advantage of reconfigurable commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) parts instead of ?hardening? the underlying computer materials to prevent faults from occurring.  The proposed approach expects faults to occur and provides a recovery procedure to mitigate their impact.  By avoiding the expensive hardening process and using COTS parts, the cost of the proposed technology is reduced over existing solutions.  The architecture used to recover from faults simultaneously provides the ability to embed advanced algorithm accelerators in the computer to increase its computational performance with greater power efficiency than existing solutions. This approach has been tested on numerous space demonstrations including small satellites, the International Space Station, and in 2024 it will travel to the lunar surface for its harshest test yet.  The advancement in computation provided by this technology may enable future space missions with greater science return and deeper exploration of the galaxy by increasing spacecraft autonomy and real-time science data processing.  In addition, an additional layer of fault intrusion defense obfuscates the computing hardware so that malware cyberattacks may be detected and defeated. This extends the use of this technology beyond space and into terrestrial applications such as the nation?s critical infrastructure that must withstand both environmentally induced faults and human initiated cyberattacks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Typically, studies of ecological and evolutionary interactions focus on means of interaction metrics, although other aspects of distributions of those metrics, such as variance and skew, can also be critical for ecology and evolution. The Herbivory Variability Research Coordination Network will advance science by expanding thinking beyond a focus on means to include the causes and consequences of variability itself. To illustrate, variation in temperature and precipitation can be more important than averages to species performance and interactions. Less appreciated is that variation in the abundance of one species across space and time can drive the outcome of its interactions with other species and may even impact evolutionary trajectories. Understanding the role of variability in the ecology and evolution of species interactions is becoming increasingly important as climate change and biodiversity loss lead to increased environmental variability and decreased biological variability. The network will focus on herbivory because it is an ecologically and economically important interaction that is easy to measure, exhibits great variation within and among species, and is a key variable in many important ecological and evolutionary theories. The foundations developed for studying variability in herbivory, however, could be extended to better understand any type of species interactions. Because the causes and consequences of interaction variability relate to so many disciplines, the network will bring together ecologists, evolutionary biologists, mathematicians, statisticians, chemists, and other scientists to collaborate via working groups that tackle synthesis, theory, data, and education projects.This project will also afford research training opportunities. <br/><br/>This project will form a Research Coordination Network (The Herbivory Variability Network, ?HerbVar?), which will bring together scientists from across fields and career stages with the common goal of understanding the causes and consequences of interaction variability.

In most cases, one species (the subordinate competitor) is more affected than the other (the dominant competitor), and competition can limit the population size or even cause local extinction of subordinate species.  This happens in two ways.  Most obviously, there are direct interactions such as the dominant competitor stealing food from the subordinate.  Less obviously, there are costs to subordinates of avoiding direct interactions, for example, by moving away from an area with abundant food but where the dominant competitor is likely to be encountered.  This research will use cutting edge technology to test how direct and indirect effects of competition affect the movements, energy gain and loss, survival, and reproduction of African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) in areas with high and low numbers of their dominant competitor, the lion (Panthera leo), and with high and low numbers of prey.   Because prey populations are declining in many areas of the world, understanding how changes in prey abundance alter the effect of competition is essential for conservation and management.<br/><br/>It is widely recognized that prey populations can be limited not only by direct predation, but also by the costs of avoiding predation (?risk effects?).  Logic suggests that risk effects might also exist in competitive interactions.  This project will test whether the avoidance of risk carries energetic costs that translate into effects on survival, reproduction, population dynamics, and gene flow in a subordinate competitor, the African wild dog.  The project will incorporate new methods into long-term studies of African wild dog, lion, and prey populations in three ecosystems.  Specifically, direct observation of wild dogs will be coupled to data from GPS collars, high frequency triaxial accelerometers, and magnetic field intensity sensors to obtain very fine-scaled data on movement, dynamic body acceleration, energy expenditure, and energy gain for wild dogs hunting in areas with known densities and distributions of lions and prey.  Triaxial accelerometers will provide detailed and precise measurements of vectorial dynamic body acceleration (VeDBA) and energy expenditure at time scales ranging from seconds to days or months.  GPS collars will provide inferences on space use and movement from dynamic Brownian bridge movement models (dBBMMs) at time scales from hours to years. dBBMMs or other movement models fit to trajectories derived from a combination of VeDBA, magnetic field intensity, and GPS locations will test for effects on movement down to the scale of seconds.   Direct observation of the same individuals in continuous three-day ?follows? will provide spatiotemporally matched data on encounters with prey, hunts, and kills to quantify energy gain at time scales from hours to years, and will provide critical context for the interpretation of other data.  By pairing these data with intensive, long-term monitoring of known individuals, relationships with survival, reproduction, and population dynamics can be tested using a Bayesian integrated population model, and effects on gene flow understood by using a SNP chip already developed and validated. Data for a range of ecological conditions will be collected through replication of the study across three ecosystems with well-measured variation in the densities of competitors and prey.
