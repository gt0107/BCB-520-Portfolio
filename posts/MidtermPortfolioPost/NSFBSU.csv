The focus of the work is particularly crucial in the region as Idaho is one of the fastest-growing states in the country, Boise State University is the largest public university with the largest engineering college in the state, and the Boise metropolitan area in southern Idaho contains the state's three largest cities by population. The Latinx population is approximately 13% and is the largest underserved population in Idaho, with the majority in southern Idaho. The university is also located in the state capitol, a vigorous center for government, business, and innovation. This planning effort focuses on strengthening pathways, ensuring community, and changing the culture so Boise State serves transfer students from Idaho community colleges.<br/><br/>The emphasis of the work is on the concept of ""servingness,"" which research has correlated to positive academic, non-academic, and student experience outcomes at Hispanic-serving Institutions (HSIs). The team already engages with the College of Western Idaho (CWI) and the College of Southern Idaho (CSI). CWI is an emerging HSI, and CSI just became an HSI in 2021. Planning work will advance knowledge of organizational development, the servingness framework, and its study and application to help emerging institutions build an identity as an HSI that serves rather than merely enrolling Hispanic students. The team will examine potentially transformative features: improving pathways and placement for students transferring from community colleges, intentional community building practices, and the cultural shifts required to educate and incentivize faculty to employ inclusive teaching practices. As the planning effort moves toward best practices, this experience can contribute to the literature and introduce practical solutions to other universities in partnership with community colleges. Broader impacts include meeting the needs of our Latinx population, representing 24% of the state's growth over the last decade. This community has also provided 31% employment growth since 2009. Idaho has a low percentage of students attending college (40%), and many area high schools are designated Title 1 and rural; many of these students may  initially attend community colleges. The knowledge and partnerships gained from this proposal are imperative to increase the number of these students seeking an additional educational opportunity at four-year institutions. Other universities can also gain from findings resulting from this effort about math placement, curriculum complexity, and cultural change. Finally, the effort will help strengthen partnerships with community colleges, helping Idaho become more of a transparent system that students can easily navigate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To do so, the project team will capitalize on emerging momentum in two tracks that are poised for growth and investment: market-oriented (Track 1) and community-engaged (Track 2) translational research. The market-oriented track will address commercialization and traditional technology transfer work that identifies innovations in the laboratory and moves them efficiently to the marketplace (e.g., problem identification, innovation, intellectual property protection, industry collaboration, and translation through licensing or startups). The community-engaged track addresses innovations in human systems, healthy ecosystems, public policymaking, and democratic governance. This track is designed to better equip federal, state, local, tribal governments as well as NGOs, nonprofits and community organizations with the tools and networks to manage and respond to socio-economic changes resulting from stressors, such as, a rapidly increasing population, greater pressures on natural resources, and changing climate conditions. During the first year of the project, seven ART Ambassadors will champion program development, policy reform, and the reallocation of resources to support translational research. Program mentor, Arizona State University?s Global Center for Tech Transfer team, will work with Boise State to advise on strategic areas of investment, identify hindrances and roadblocks to a successful translational research process, and serve as a resource for training and institutional capacity building. In building, testing, and advancing translational research systems, the ART Ambassadors will invest in Seed Translational Research Projects based on translational potential, responsiveness to priority societal problems, strong partnerships, and training opportunities for postdocs and graduate students.<br/><br/>Boise State?s ART project represents a deliberate effort to improve the university?s connections and role within the regional entrepreneurial ecosystem. The project team will consolidate a set of institutional initiatives to foster the growth of this entrepreneurial ecosystem, integrating university and industry leadership, mobilizing faculty expertise to support dialogue and evidence-based decision making, and creating a robust network of partners. By strengthening its institutional capacity in translational research, Boise State will be an active partner of new industries that are rapidly expanding in the region and will support government officials and NGOs to design collaborative solutions to pressing social, environmental, and policy problems. The ART project will provide training for early career faculty, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate students to help prepare the next generation of translational research professionals. Project leadership and ART Ambassadors will ensure inclusiveness and accessibility in all aspects of the proposed work, including lowering barriers to participation, implementing inclusive mentoring networks, and assessing diversity and inclusiveness in the translational research community on campus and with external partners. By the end of the ART program, Boise State will demonstrate an upward trajectory in the ?Big 5? translational research metrics: invention disclosures, new patent applications, total licenses, license revenue, and startups formed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Nanoscale materials exhibit physical behavior drastically different from that of macroscopic materials, thus opening new opportunities for novel device applications. This project studies nanoscale ferroelectrics and multiferroics, a class of materials both interesting for fundamental research and practically important due to high potential for applications in various devices, such as computer memories, microwave electronic devices or in next-generation transistors. The research is closely integrated into the educational program at Boise State University, involving undergraduate and graduate students in research and training, thus making them well prepared for careers in physical sciences and materials engineering. Such graduates are on demand by electronics and materials industries, such as Micron Technology, Hewlett Packard, and other high-tech companies in Boise metropolitan area. The project promotes an active use of the state-of-the-art instrumentation for educational purposes and supports the development of new graduate programs. It broadens the involvement of students from under-represented groups in the cutting-edge scientific research. The project enhances Boise State?s strength in condensed-matter physics and materials science. <br/><br/>Technical description:<br/>Complex metal oxides are a vast class of materials that have a wide variety of functional properties attractive for novel device applications. Among these functionalities are ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism, properties of materials to possess spontaneous electric polarization or magnetization, which can be switched by applying electric or magnetic field, respectively. Ferroelectrics and multiferroics, materials that exhibit both magnetic and ferroelectric ordering, have been in the focus of intensive research activity in the last several years, driven by potential new functionalities for novel device applications arising from the coupling between the electrical and magnetic order parameters. Artificially engineered thin films and multilayer structures at nanometer scales are of particular interest, due to new physical phenomena and properties dramatically different from those of homogeneous bulk ferroelectrics. This project utilizes variable-temperature Raman spectroscopy with ultraviolet excitation to address several issues of major importance for understanding the behavior of nanoscale ferroelectrics and multiferroics, focusing on size effects in ferroelectric nanomaterials and temperature-strain phase diagrams in thin films and heterostructures of novel materials predicted to have ferroelectric and multiferroic properties in strained thin film form. These results are used to test the predictions of thermodynamic and first-principles theories and combined with thorough characterization of structural, electrical and magnetic properties, leading to a more comprehensive understanding of nanoscale ferroelectricity and magnetoelectric coupling.

Through this project, rural schools in Idaho will have access to more highly prepared STEM teachers (e.g. mathematics, science, engineering, and computer science teachers). The project is scheduled to provide full tuition scholarships for 16 TFs to earn a Master?s in Teaching degree and an Idaho teaching 6-12 certificate via Boise State University?s College of Education. After completing teacher certification, the TFs will receive annual salary supplements during their first four years of teaching.  This project takes an innovative approach to recruiting and preparing STEM degree holders to become secondary teachers in rural high-need school districts. The proposed fellowship program is positioned to establish a new place-based residency strategy within an existing master?s degree program at Boise State University.  This residency program aims to integrate coursework with classroom experiences, allowing TFs to apprentice under the constant guidance of an experienced mentor teacher. The community-based focus of this project is designed to ensure the program is attractive and effective for STEM professionals already living in rural communities. An extended induction support program is designed to support TFs to engage in collaborative community-focused analysis of their instruction as they develop local leadership capacity. <br/><br/>This project at Boise State University includes partnerships with several rural Idaho high-need school districts (Blaine County, Caldwell, Hansen, Kimberly, Wendell, and Twin Falls), the Idaho Business for Education organization, the Idaho Workforce Development Council, and the Idaho STEM Action Center Project. The project goals include: (1) recruit and select a diverse cohort of 16 well-qualified TFs with high geographic diversity, (2) ensure all TFs gain the cultural competencies, pedagogical techniques, and professional dispositions necessary to be successful STEM teachers in their rural settings, and (3) provide quality induction support so that TFs and their mentors can be effective leaders in addressing community-valued goals for increased participation in STEM. The 6-year project includes external project evaluation collecting data throughout the program, with two questions to guide the project evaluation: (1) How effective is the fellowship program in supplying STEM teachers to rural, high-need schools? and (2) Which program and induction practices of the program are most associated with candidates' and graduates' use of responsive teaching practices? Results will provide information about the potential value of teacher certification models for teacher education programs and high-need districts. Findings will be broadly disseminated to inform national efforts to recruit and prepare STEM professionals to be highly qualified STEM teachers. This Track 2: Teaching Fellowships project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the effectiveness and retention of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Tso Morari complex in northern India represents one of the largest and youngest of these ultrahigh pressure terranes. The size and youth of this complex, coupled with analytical advances over the last decade, permit us to collect uniquely precise metamorphic pressures, temperatures, ages, and structural measurements across a wide geographic region. These spatially distributed datasets will allow us to discriminate among competing models for how such ultrahigh pressure rocks form and are exhumed during continental collisions. This work will advance science and US interests by supporting the directed research and education efforts of 2 PhD students and 2-6 undergraduate students. Additional educational benefits will accrue to as many as 25 geology majors per year at Boise State University in mineralogy and petrology classes, 25 geology majors per year at Washington State University in a structural geology class, and 1500 undergraduates per year at Washington State University in general geology classes. Both Boise State and Washington State Universities serve an unusual demographic with high Latino and military veteran student populations. Co-PI Long recruits students at local community colleges, which will allow research results and educational opportunities to be disseminated to a broader regional audience. Both PIs will also present results at the Wadia Institute, India, reaching a broad international demographic and advancing science internationally.<br/><br/>Ultrahigh pressure metamorphic rocks form within or above the coesite stability field and are observed in many orogens. The mechanisms by which ultrahigh pressure rocks form and exhume is a long-standing problem in tectonics. Based on data collected from the Tso Morari complex in India, we will test two important hypotheses that derive from thermal-mechanical models of ultrahigh pressure metamorphism: 1) Ultrahigh pressure cycles (burial to peak P-T conditions and exhumation to ~1 GPa) occur in c. 5 Myr, and 2) Ultrahigh pressure rocks are buried, exhumed, and emplaced as coherent sheets. Specifically, we propose to answer the following questions: 1) At what time and at what pressure-temperature conditions were Tso Morari complex rocks metamorphosed, and how long did ultrahigh pressure metamorphism last? 2) At what time and at what pressure-temperature conditions did amphibolite-facies overprinting occur, and how long did the Tso Morari complex rocks remain hot? 3) What was the rate of cooling? 4) Over what temperature range did exhumation-related shearing occur? 5) What is the spatial distribution of pressure-temperature-deformation-time paths? Data collected will include pressure-temperature conditions using inclusion and rim thermobarometry, Lu-Hf ages on pre-ultrahigh pressure garnet cores and ultrahigh pressure garnet rims, U-Pb ages on any high-U rutile inclusions, 40Ar/39Ar ages of hornblende and muscovite, quartz c-axis opening angle thermometry, and diffusion modeling of chemical gradients in garnet. Pressure-temperature-deformation-time paths will be collected from at least 8 localities located at extremes along the subduction and exhumation transport directions. Systematic along-transport differences in these paths will discriminate whether the ultrahigh pressure unit was metamorphosed and exhumed as a coherent sheet (as currently assumed) or as multiple or complex structures. Results will be integrated with diverse thermal-mechanical models of UHP metamorphism using multiple chronometers in single or proximal outcrops to minimize geographic extrapolation, determine ages along- and across-strike, make direct comparisons to published thermal-mechanical models, and identify when mid-crustal emplacement of the Tso Morari complex occurred.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of this collaborative project is to form a higher education consortium across Southern Idaho that provides responsive recruiting, retention, and career pathways for engineering and computer science (ECS) students. Over its six year duration, this project will fund scholarships to 136 unique full-time students who are pursuing associate?s and bachelor?s degrees in  Electrical and Computer Engineering.  Transfer students will received a 2-year scholarship at the partner community college of origin and will continue to be funded for their Bachelor?s degree at Boise State University.<br/><br/>Toward this goal, this project establishes a cohort-based experience with scholarship support for financially eligible, academically talented students in ECS programs These institutions serve three of the counties with the largest Hispanic population percentage in the state as well as a significant proportion of the state?s low-income rural population. This collaborative project will develop new accessible pathways into ECS careers and create an educational ecosystem that provides opportunities for low-income students with demonstrated academic potential to pursue a rewarding ECS career. This approach will counter known constraints of the current pipeline metaphor including providing multiple access points and addressing leaks that result in students pivoting to programs outside of  an ECS degree or leaving college altogether. Creating recruiting and retention pathways in these areas will help support underserved populations in Idaho.<br/><br/>The project team will also leverage existing relationships developed through the state-wide Center for Advanced Energy Studies (CAES) to create a CAES Scholars Consortium. The CAES Scholars Consortium will establish new pathways to attract and retain students and to increase and diversify participation of low-income students in the ECS workforce. This team will focus on approaches to recruitment, retention, and careers. The CAES Scholars will be a cohort model that is connected virtually through a common set of activities shared across the consortium partners across the state. Each cohort will participate in activities to build a professional community around students in ECS programs with close collaboration and mentorship from professionals working in the energy sector, such as the Idaho National Laboratory. In subsequent years, upper-class students will become peer mentors to help newer students navigate the challenges related to transitions along the pathways. The research component investigates how these new pathways will improve self-efficacy, in particular the relationship between ECS literacy and ECS identity, and subsequent ECS retention. It is hypothesized that a strong ECS identity, increases access to and improves retention through the transitions along the pathways. The project will also examine how student experiences and related professional identity formation differ among students with different pathways or initial institution enrollment.<br/><br/>This project is funded by NSF?s Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields. It also aims to improve the education of future STEM workers, and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Over 150 billion terabytes a year are predicted to be generated by 2025. DNA has emerged as a next-generation data storage solution due to its high stability and high information density. However, the potential of DNA-based information storage has not been fully exploited due to the cost and energy required for DNA synthesis and sequencing. In this project, self-assembled DNA nanostructures place DNA data strands with nanometer precision in all three dimensions. The stored information is recovered optically by time-resolved super-resolution microscopy. As a result, the need for unique DNA strands is significantly reduced with a corresponding decrease in the cost of synthesis. Furthermore, data readout is non-destructive and storage volume scales beyond terabyte levels. This project develops and delivers workforce development training at the interface of Synthetic Biology and Semiconductor research. Students trained through this project will be immersed in an interdisciplinary research team with expertise in Material Science, Synthetic Biology, Computer Science and Electrical Engineering. The research results will be disseminated through high-impact journals, premier conferences, websites, and social media, and will be integrated into multiple courses at Boise State. The research team will partner with the Boise State Institute for Inclusive and Transformative Scholarship to recruit and retain students from underrepresented backgrounds.<br/><br/>The project aims to advance DNA-based information storage through robust data encoding/decoding algorithms, deep neural network-based image processing, scalable synthetic biology, custom imaging arrays, and an evolution-inspired sequence optimization algorithm. To do so, a rotation-invariant data-encoding, error-correction scheme will be developed along with a state-of-the-art deep neural network-based approach for adaptive image processing, and a Bayes-optimal data recovery/error correction algorithm to optimize probe localization and drift correction. Large custom DNA ?scaffolds? with orthogonal DNA staple strands will be created to construct origami with more data sites per assembly. DNA scaffolds will be created to allow multiple storage nodes to be built in a single ?one-pot? synthesis. A time-correlated super-resolution microscopy technique will be developed, which seamlessly integrates super-resolution and fluorescence lifetime microscopy to record interactions between dye-labeled imager strands and their sequence complement in three dimensions. Custom imaging arrays based on state-of-art single-photon avalanche diode technology will be designed and manufactured by commercial foundry services to achieve 5 X 5 X 1 nm readout resolution. Finally, an evolution-inspired sequence optimization algorithm will be developed to optimize DNA sequences both for readout and origami synthesis. In doing so, this work will increase information density that can be stored in DNA nanostructures and the efficiency of read, which reduces the amount of DNA needed for large scale data storage, improving both the scalability and sustainability of DNA-based information storage.<br/><br/>The project was jointly funded by Division of Electrical, Communications and Cyber Systems (ECCS) in the Directorate for Engineering (ENG), Division of Computing and Communication Foundations (CCF) in the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE), Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences (MCB) in the Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO), and the Division of Materials Research (DMR) in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this project, Boise State University will collaborate with Caldwell, Jerome, Kimberly, Kuna, and Vallivue school districts to identify, recruit, and then support students interested in pursuing STEM teaching careers. During students' first two years of study, opportunities for support include an on-campus Living and Learning Community and STEM education summer internships in students' home communities. Students will complete Boise State University's four-year BS/certification program for the STEM disciplines (IDoTeach). In addition to scholarship support in their last two years of study, the project will support their transition into STEM teaching careers with an induction program that prepares new teachers to be teacher-leaders. This project aims to prepare teachers to enter the profession with knowledge of the systemic barriers that limit equitable instruction for a range of students, so that they are better advocate for the interests and needs of their increasingly diverse communities.<br/><br/>This proposal's merits lie in its efforts to increase the number and quality of STEM teachers for Idaho's secondary schools.  Concomitant with these efforts is the goal to identify mechanisms that support an increase in the number of teachers, particularly with respect to the needs of rural, isolated districts. The theory of action behind this proposal is that explicit attention to students' geography in recruitment, internship placement, preparation, and ongoing support will close a loop: Students will be recruited from, prepared to teach within, and ultimately hired to serve as STEM educators for their rural home communities. Program evaluation will identify features of the recruitment, preparation and retention efforts that impact the number of teachers in rural school districts.

However, as software continues to increase in size and complexity, program analysts and software engineers find it increasingly challenging to keep computer software secure, reliable, and safe. To do so, they use what is called software verification. Program invariants are an essential part of software verification; they are summaries of possible program behaviors. Unfortunately, current methods for computing program invariants are not keeping pace with software complexity, resulting in approaches that do not scale well, or which compute imprecise, i.e., weak program invariants. In addition, while better strategies for developing program invariants are available, they are too difficult for most engineers to apply without highly specialized training. This project will produce novel techniques to overcome these limitations to compute strong program invariants, and to do so far more easily. Since program invariants touch on so many parts of software engineering such as generating, debugging, verifying, and optimizing computer code, improved accuracy and efficiency can transform software development. In addition, the investigator at Boise State University in Boise, Idaho will work closely with regional industry professionals both to enhance their verification training, as well as to collaborate in co-developing a graduate-level class on applied program analysis.<br/><br/>The project will use an approach for computing program invariants called abstract interpretation. Key to effective abstract interpretation is choosing an appropriate abstraction level for static code analysis. On the one hand, if the abstraction is too fine, it will not scale well. On the other hand, if the abstraction is too coarse, it will compute weak invariants. This project will result in a novel approach for finding suitable abstractions that allows for a scalable, precise, and far more accessible method of computing program invariants. The resulting Search-based Static Analysis (SBSA) framework will significantly improve upon current static analysis methods and use search techniques to automatically optimize abstract interpreter configurations. It will also facilitate new research directions that require strong program invariants. There are three project objectives, to: (1) investigate search techniques to find the best abstract domain, (2) explore mechanisms for guiding the abstract domain search based on software concrete semantics, and (3) improve precision by strategically partitioning software into components and then analyzing them separately to enable better search.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These changing weather patterns could affect how much of the precipitation flows into streams (becoming stream water) and seeps into the subsurface (becoming soil water and/or groundwater) in mountainous areas. To better manage future water resources, it is critical to understand how a watershed responds to climate change regarding the partitioning of precipitation into stream water, soil water, and groundwater. This project will focus on quantifying various water storages and fluxes at different elevations in a semi-arid watershed in the western United States. Both field tests and computational simulations will be performed. The collected scientific data and developed computational models in this project will contribute to an improved understanding of how the water resources in the mountains respond to climate change.

Traditionally, STEM graduate training has focused more on instilling technical content expertise and less on cultivating feelings of belonging and STEM identity critical to graduate student retention and success in STEM programs. This project addresses these missing components by developing a cohort-based program wherein students learn and apply storytelling techniques through writing and sharing transformative stories about themselves. Aided by a novel collaboration with The Story Collider, a nonprofit organization that aims to foster diversity and inclusion in science through storytelling, the project team will develop, implement, and assess the transferability of an innovative personal storytelling intervention with students at the two universities. Each project year will culminate in public performances in which participant cohorts perform their stories to university and community peers and stakeholders. The open-source storytelling curriculum will be made available through online repositories for the STEM education community to share and customize.<br/><br/>This project will expand pedagogical knowledge of effective instructional practices for developing graduate students into STEM professionals and advance theoretical knowledge in the fields of STEM education and narrative psychology. Using storytelling to engage STEM students in reflection at a time when they encounter intense intellectual and personal challenges, this intervention will engage STEM graduate students in formal trainings about storytelling techniques and then facilitate their practice of these techniques within a community of STEM graduate students. Training and peer interactions culminate in a personal story that each student may publicly perform. The project examines three hypotheses: (1) storytelling pedagogy will improve STEM graduate student professional identity and sense of belonging, and reduce feelings of impostorism, (2) storytelling performances will reinforce student retention and transition into STEM fields, and (3) storytelling performances will decrease the stereotyping among audience members of those who pursue STEM careers. Adopting a mixed-methods research approach, the project team will answer three research questions: (1) What are the thematic and structural characteristics of personal narratives that students write about their experiences in STEM graduate education? (2) How do students? development and performance of a personal narrative about their experiences in STEM graduate education relate to their professional identity, sense of belonging, and feelings of impostorism? (3) How do the thematic and structural characteristics of personal narratives relate to the three professional constructs of professional identity, sense of belonging, and impostorism? The project team will collect and analyze mixed methods data, including participants? stories, focus group interviews, and self-report measures related to professional identity, sense of belonging, and impostor phenomenon.

This research develops analytical tools to reconstruct paleoenvironments using molecular-based techniques; specifically, understanding the strengths and limitations of the analysis of hydrogen and oxygen isotopes from the protein in animal bones. Hydrogen and oxygen isotope ratios in the earth?s surface water vary with environmental parameters like temperature and aridity; subsequently these atoms are incorporated into animal tissues through food and water intake, and to some degree can be used as tracers of those original environmental variables. The advantages of understanding the systematics of hydrogen and oxygen isotopic records in animal bones include providing local environmental information at sites with direct human use; the integration of up to five isotope ratios (hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, sulfur), radiocarbon ages, and protein-based species identification; and the ability to use legacy collections and fragmentary bone samples where other materials like teeth are rare. This approach can be applied at archaeological and paleontological sites anywhere worldwide where protein is preserved in bones. Overall this work supports and complements more traditional archaeological approaches to understand the past. This research is conducted in and supports the infrastructure of the Stable Isotope Laboratory at Boise State University, a university facility serving the geosciences, archaeology, and biology. Outreach activities include participation in a campus science and engineering open day and science outreach with young tribal members. <br/><br/>This project has three main components. First, assesses how hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in bone protein (collagen) of medium/large mammals change over time at long-duration cave sites and their utility for paleoenvironmental reconstruction, including integration with carbon and nitrogen isotopes and newly-generated radiocarbon dates. Second, furthers the use of peptide mass fingerprinting (ZooMS/MALDI-TOF) to identify the animal species of fragmentary bone material. Third, testing how these protein-based isotopic approaches compare to oxygen and carbon isotopic work on inorganic hard tissues like tooth enamel, which then allows comparison of old and new data sets.

Because their viscosity is low, they usually form lava flows or weak explosive eruptions. However, mafic-composition volcanoes can produce much stronger, Plinian-style eruptions capable of dispersing ash fall over thousands of square kilometers, and producing deadly, landscape-altering ash flows that travel tens of kilometers from source.  Despite their potential impact, the mechanisms responsible for generating mafic, Plinian eruptions are not understood. This project will benefit society by constraining the causes and consequences of such eruptions, which has global implications for the millions of people living at risk from mafic volcanic centers including the currently active Kilauea volcano in the USA. Two Boise State University (BSU) PhD students will be trained by the five participating scientists on the team, advancing discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning. Undergraduate geoscience students from the Universidad de Concepcion (Chile) will be included in the field work and research, broadening participation of under-represented groups. The results and experience of the research team will be shared on the BSU magmatic and volcanic studies group Facebook page through a series of blog post and short videos of our field work that document the key elements of discovery associated with the project. Finally, the investigators and students will incorporate samples, stories, images and videos from the work in Chile into local and regional outreach efforts.<br/><br/>This project targets the 13.4_ka (~12 km3 DRE) and ~12.6 ka (<1 km3 DRE) mafic eruptions at Volcan Llaima, Chile, which produced extensive ash flow deposits found radially around the volcano. The difference in eruption sizes permits investigation of processes that promote large-volume, caldera forming mafic eruptions versus smaller volume Plinian mafic eruptions. A full suite of diverse but complimentary methods, including petrology, geochemistry, physical volcanology, decompression experiments, and rheology experiments, allows the research team to address the broad, fundamental research question of what magmatic and crustal conditions promote and trigger mafic, Plinian eruptions. More specifically, spatially and stratigraphically constrained petrologic and geochemical studies will allow us to investigate magmatic conditions during and prior to eruption, such as compositional variability of the magma and changes in chamber temperatures, pressures, and gas content. Establishing variability in these conditions will permit reconstruction of the magma plumbing system. A combination of all methods are used to constrain conduit conditions that promote high explosivity for mafic melts, including the interplay between ascent rate and degassing of the magma, as well as changes in magma rheology that prevent gas loss, promoting higher explosivity.

To accomplish this, the principle investigator will integrate functionally patterned graphene and graphene derivatives into bioscaffolds to control and measure the fundamental biophysical cues that encode information for human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC) growth and differentiation. Electrical connections to the graphene bioscaffolds will serve to modulate temperature and electrical fields while also actively monitoring the electrochemical exchange at the cell-graphene interface during growth and differentiation. In order to elucidate graphene's structure-property-processing correlations on hMSC differentiation, genetic profiles will be compared for hMSC growth on epitaxial graphene on SiC substrates, polycrystalline graphene films grown by chemical vapor deposition on copper foils, and graphene films printed from chemically exfoliated graphene nanoflakes. Electrical bias applied to the graphene films will be used to monitor the effect of transmembrane voltage on hMSC fate, as well as the impact of electrical signals on extracellular matrix production and the mechanical properties of engineered musculoskeletal tissue. Intellectual Merit: The fundamental knowledge gained will enable a complete set of design rules for electrically active bioscaffolds that can couple or decouple biophysical cues responsible for stem cell growth and differentiation. The data produced through these experiments will be made publicly available to further advance in silico research of biomolecular processes and subsequent integration in virtual physiological human models. Broader Impacts: By integrating graphene into the tissue engineering cycle, potentially transformational outcomes will likely include new instrumentation for stem cell culture, new multifunctional bioscaffold materials, and new research avenues for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Integrated educational outreach activities leverage a local dual-language immersion public charter school and undergraduate service-learning programs to raise awareness about STEM opportunities for English language learners. <br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT<br/>Stem cells offer the remarkable ability to develop into many different cell types and tissues. Thus, they not only have the potential to cure damaged or diseased organs, but also provide a platform to study the fundamental chemistry of life. Researchers have long studied stem cell biology in vitro with a focus on the impact of biochemical reactions and mechanical cues on stem cell fate. These scientists culture stem cells on various types of materials which serve as bioscaffolds, engineering the materials to leverage the mechanical crosstalk between the stem cell and the scaffold to control their fate. There are few investigations that leverage electrical and thermal cues which vary in space and time to control stem cell fate. The recent discovery of graphene (a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a 2-dimensional hexagonal crystal structure) has opened up new possibilities for bioscaffolds to control such electrical and thermal interactions with stem cells. Therefore, the goal of this NSF CAREER award is to integrate graphene with stem cell biology to uncover the fundamental interactions of these two systems. Intellectual Merit The proposed work will have an impact on stem cell biology and atomically thin materials research by providing new fundamental insights into the role of electrical and thermal cues in controlling stem cell fate. Broader Impacts: Achieving control over stem cell fate could revolutionize tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, reducing dependence on organ donors to treat patient end-stage organ failure. Scientific outreach activities will help establish a pipeline of English language learners from a local dual-language immersion program into Boise State University's STEM programs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These batteries are among the most promising energy storage technologies and are much needed for near-term growth of the renewable energy and electric vehicle markets. This project examines how electroceramic materials (used in batteries) can be intentionally altered by adding impurities or producing other defects. For electrode (i.e., anode and cathode) materials, conductivity is critical for high energy and high-power lithium ion batteries. Recent research demonstrates improved performance when electrode materials contain defects, with the potential to extend battery energy, power density, stability, tolerance in extreme conditions, and calendar life. This project focuses on and explores the model oxide system, titania (TiO2) to shed light on the underlying conductivity phenomena in these electroceramic materials. In addition, this project is coupled to education, diversity, and training activities that are integrated across two participating universities (Boise State and Purdue). For example, this project is implementing a cross-institutional undergraduate researcher 'exchange' program.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: This study presents a unique method for tailoring ionic/electronic conductivity using irradiation, which could open new research pathways in irradiation-enhanced materials functionality and lead to an unprecedented advancement in tailoring electrochemical performance in electroceramic materials. The project investigates the hypothesis that irradiation-induced defects can provide tunable control over the mixed ionic/electronic conductivity in electroceramic materials, thus delivering enhanced electrochemical properties for lithium-ion battery applications. Electrodes containing extrinsic (e.g., doping) and intrinsic defects (e.g., vacancies, cation disorder) exhibit improved electrochemical properties. Specifically, extrinsic defects may enhance electronic conductivity, while intrinsic defects may enhance ionic conductivity. Intermediate energy ion irradiation creates intrinsic defects, while the irradiating ion species becomes implanted in the target material as extrinsic defects. Thus, it is theorized that the appropriate selection of the irradiating ion species and energy enables tuning of the ionic and electronic conductivity to produce better electrochemical properties. This project focuses on a model metal oxide, TiO2 (anatase). Specimens irradiated with niobium ions to produce both intrinsic and extrinsic defects, are compared to specimens irradiated with helium ions, which diffuse from the target material and leave behind only intrinsic defects. The hypothesis is being tested on crystalline thin films, which enables a mechanistic understanding of intermediate energy irradiation effects on metal oxides to be formed. Building on these results, research on a polycrystalline nanoarchitectured TiO2 electrode follows to elucidate the ion irradiation effect on the electrochemical properties of the electrode. This research is being incorporated into teaching and outreach modules for integration across the two participating institutions and is being made available via NanoHUB.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research examines rocks from several different mountain belts that have been subjected to different pressures and temperatures through geologic time. The project supports the education and training of graduate and undergraduate students, including students from underserved groups. In addition, samples collected during the research are the focus of undergraduate in-class mineralogy and petrology exercises at Boise State University, which serves an unique student demographic (significant percentages of Hispanic, returning, and veteran students).<br/> <br/>The central focus of this project is to critically evaluate the hypothesis that metamorphic crystals grow substantially out of chemical equilibrium in a rock. A novel approach using inclusion elastic thermobarometry is applied to recover temperature and pressure independent of mineral chemistry. Three main research questions include: (1) Does inclusion elastic barometry and thermometry yield significantly different P-T paths compared to thermodynamically-based methods? (2) Does inclusion elastic barometry and thermometry imply static growth of garnet cores, perhaps even encompassing entire crystals in low-grade rocks? (3) Do differences either in matrix strain or in bulk compositions that shift equilibrium garnet growth to higher temperatures reduce the amount of overstepping, the size of garnet cores, and the bias to calculated P-T paths? Analyses include measurements of pressure and temperature for four different orogenic belts: the northern Appalachians, central Alps, southernmost Chile, and central/eastern Himalaya. Results broadly evaluate the frequency and magnitude of disequilibrium garnet growth, as well as the effects of temperature and strain on garnet nucleation. This research includes a PhD student and undergraduate students to make measurements, interpret data, present results at international meetings, and write up results for publication.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To do so, the investigator will develop new machine learning algorithms to better detect authenticity and recommend content. The research integrates computer and social sciences to account for the complex real-world interactions among publisher, platform, content recommendation algorithms, bot users, human users, and their social connections. One way social networks engage users is by keeping them consuming personalized content. Malicious actors can easily penetrate these systems with misleading stories and consequent recommendations that prompt people to make decisions based on this misinformation. Younger generations are increasingly active on such platforms, making it critical to reduce the threat that the continuing spread of misinformation poses. Findings will result in a deeper understanding of how recommender systems behave in the presence of misleading stories, and will offer systems design strategies to insure that people receive accurate information to make decisions.<br/><br/>There is currently no framework in place to quantify how much recommendations with misinformation in the loop influence social network users. This research will fill this gap. Project objectives are to: (1) develop graph-based models to measure the degree of story, sources, and user credibility as opposed to a typical binary assessment; (2) develop a new framework integrating user-centric information diffusion models to assess the impact of, and compute benchmarks for, current recommender systems in spreading misleading stories; (3) develop algorithms for content recommender systems that will minimize misinformation spread in social networks.

These events create seismic waves in the ground and pressure waves in the air, which contain valuable information that can be analyzed to understand these often-hazardous processes. However, data gathering in these fields are currently impaired by an instrumentation gap: available recording instrumentation is typically expensive and can be burdensome to install as it is usually specialized to record waves either in the ground or air but not both. Although recording ground and air propagating waves using many spatially dispersed sensors could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the geophysical processes that create them, it is currently not practical due to lack of affordable instrumentation. In this project, we propose to develop an instrument to facilitate simultaneous recording of seismic and pressure waves that is easy and economical to install in large numbers. Additionally, we will disseminate the benefits of this instrument by operating an instrument lending pool for the duration of the project. This will help geophysicists record more comprehensive datasets that yield a clearer understanding of powerful, hazardous events. Our project will include 4-6 undergraduate and graduate assistants in roles like electronics construction and repair, instrument testing, programming, documentation, and fieldwork.<br/><br/>The geophysical data logger will have an integrated sensors to simultaneously record seismic and infrasound signals; its low cost, low power consumption, and ease of use will permit users to install dense recording networks and perform detailed analyses. Infrasound studies may elucidate many phenomena in earth science including volcanoes, explosions, earthquakes, debris flows, lahars, and avalanches. However, most infrasound studies are limited by instrumentation due to its high cost, high power requirements, and specialized training needed to deploy them. These issues are particularly problematic for ?large-N? campaigns (where excellent resolution is achieved by recording very large numbers of sensors), as well as projects in sites that are remote, sensitive, hazardous, or theft-prone. The Gem infrasound logger-- the only available integrated infrasound sensor-logger--addresses these issues and has supported several field projects that would not have been practical with other instruments. Additionally, the Gem?s ease of use helps non-specialists incorporate infrasound study into multi-disciplinary projects, leading to innovative new applications. Developing a next-generation Gem model with simultaneous seismic and acoustic recording capabilities (2 channels, with 200 Hz and 24 bits/channel) will result in another one-of-a-kind instrument that will provide infrasound scientists with seismic context with no additional effort, and vice-versa. The proposed instrument lending pool will satisfy an unmet need in infrasound science: unlike the related field of seismology in which field campaigns can borrow instruments from PASSCAL, no institution currently lends infrasound sensors. Our proposed lending pool will promote infrasound science and recording possibilities for scientists that don?t have their own field instrumentation and for infrasound specialists conducting large-N campaigns.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This award establishes a new mode of manufacturing for low temperature fabrication of high quality two-dimensional nanomaterials, which allows early adoption of these new materials into the semiconductor industry and supports continued improvements in electronic device performance, including information storage capacity and computational power, all while lowering the energy demands of these devices. These materials are also promising components of quantum information processing devices, thus aligning well with NSF's Quantum Leap effort. The results of this research benefits society and the national economy through the advancement of innovative solutions to the nation's increasing energy and computational demands. Additionally, this research advances engineering knowledge and trains the next generation of scientists and engineers in advanced manufacturing and prepare them for careers in industry. Through partnership with Boise State's Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Diversity and Inclusion Initiative, the research and outreach activities of this award expands participation for underrepresented groups, directly supporting the aims of the NSF INCLUDES program. <br/><br/>Semiconducting two-dimensional (2D) atomic layer materials, such as transition metal dichalcogenides, offer large direct band gaps, high on-off ratios, and high room temperature mobilities. The key challenge to deploying these materials in memory and logic devices is the ability to synthesize them in their 2D form at device compatible temperatures with minimal substrate interaction, control over the number of layers, and control over the chemical composition for heterostructure formation and doping. Selective-area atomic layer deposition (ALD), in a unique van der Waals growth mode, can overcome the current limitations for synthesis of the 2D nanomaterials. Typically, 2D materials are grown by chemical vapor deposition at high temperatures, which is not suitable for high aspect-ratio structures. Low temperature ALD produces amorphous films, which requires high temperature annealing to generate the desired microstructure, which is not suitable for some semiconductor devices. This research is to provide the knowledge necessary to synthesize crystalline 2D atomic layer materials at backend-compatible low temperatures through selective-area or seeded ALD with van der Waals bonding to the underlying substrate. The research team employs in situ and ex situ experimentation combined with first-principles computation to understand the chemical reactions critical to both promoting and inhibiting the nucleation and growth of 2D materials on engineered surfaces for high volume semiconductor device manufacturing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The valuable data collected for this project has potential to improve computational simulation techniques, which could inform future water resource management and benefit society.<br/><br/>This research will use advanced geophysical imaging techniques to understand how anomalously wet conditions impact how meltwater enters and travels through the subsurface, and how subsurface water becomes available for use by vegetation, streamflow, and groundwater recharge. The study will be carried out at two sites in the Dry Creek Experimental Watershed near Boise, Idaho, where existing hydrometeorological information will supplement new geophysical imaging methods. Time-lapse electrical resistivity tomography will be used to monitor the daily or weekly resistivity variations related to subsurface water storage changes. A newly developed resistivity inversion scheme incorporating critical zone subsurface structure will be used to reconstruct the spatiotemporal resistivity distribution along a transect at each study site.

A critical challenge facing humanity is growing demand for nutrient-dense foods with longer shelf-life and climate resilience to reach regions of the world most impacted by extreme weather conditions, geopolitical turmoil, and mass migration. Milk is nutrient-dense, containing vitamins and minerals, fat, and protein content used to produce a range of products that are widely consumed across the world by people of all ages, from infants to seniors. However, current dairy product manufacturing methods are rate limited, and use outdated processing practices that suffer from critical efficiency shortcomings in monitoring protein integrity, separation science, and spray drying of protein powders. This project will address the knowledge gap currently preventing adoption of state-of-the-art technological solutions by creating a roadmap for the implementation of intelligent sensing and advanced manufacturing technologies aimed at efficient production of high-value products for consumers that address nutrition security at a domestic and global level. <br/><br/>The project team?s use-inspired approach targets farmers and rural communities, dairy processors, and consumers of food products containing dairy protein powder ingredients. Dairy is the single largest component of the Idaho agricultural economy, being driven predominantly by farmers and processors in rural counties, where underserved minority populations are increasing at a rapid rate in a state that is among the fastest growing in the United States. This project will focus on educational programs and workforce development for these underserved minority populations through land grant university extension outreach programs, partnership with dairy marketing and communication organizations (Dairy West), and organizations dedicated to the training and workforce development pipeline for students to careers in dairy processing (BUILD Dairy). University programs including the Vertically Integrated Project curriculum and BUILD Dairy-sponsored projects, offer students training essential for their employment in high-paying, benefit-eligible positions in rural communities throughout Idaho and the United States.<br/><br/>The goal of this Convergence Accelerator is to modernize the dairy processing industry by fusing artificial intelligence, chemometric sensing, and advanced manufacturing tools to achieve transformative efficiency, quality, and quantity gains in the production of shelf-stable, nutrient-dense, protein powder products.

These lavas can provide important information about what Earth?s uppermost (~ 120 miles) mantle is composed of and how it melts to form the majority of Earth?s crust. At present no studies have examined long chains of seamounts adjacent to mid-ocean ridges to address these fundamental questions. In this study, we plan to analyze over 400 well located lava samples from the 820'N seamount chain. The chain was previously sampled and mapped in 2016 and 2018 using the submersible Alvin and autonomous vehicle Sentry. The geochemical, mineralogical, and age data to be obtained under this project will allow us to determine the origin of the magmas that feed the seamounts and nearby ridge. The data will also tell us how those magmas evolve to form oceanic lavas, and how the volcanism is related to regional tectonic processes.  The study will promote advances in the field of geochemistry, marine geology, and geodynamics. This project will provide significant mentorship and training for students at a variety of levels.  It will fully or partially support three graduate students at Florida and Boise State and will provide training for several undergraduates in geochemical techniques and interpretation, and support senior research projects. The project will also support education and diversity by funding two female scientists, one a first-generation college graduate, toward obtaining their PhDs in geochemistry. Both principal investigators are heavily involved in outreach and education at the K-12 levels in Florida and Idaho.<br/><br/>Sparse sampling and geochemical analyses of seamounts scattered throughout the northeastern Pacific suggest the sub-ridge mantle associated with the East Pacific Rise (EPR) has far greater compositional variability then is preserved in lavas erupted on-axis. While the relative homogeneity of axial lavas has resulted in intriguing generalizations about magma differentiation and mixing processes at mid-ocean ridges (MOR), seamount studies have had a significant impact on our understanding of the source compositions for oceanic basalts, the scales of mantle heterogeneity, and mantle melting systematics at MOR. However, many of these studies have focused on dredged lavas from individual seamounts with very few combining in situ sampling and high-resolution mapping from a single chain oriented perpendicular to the ridge axis.  To fill this gap in knowledge about the sub-ridge mantle, two research cruises in 2016 and 2018 investigated the 820?N seamount chain that extends ~200km west of the EPR.  The 820?N seamount chain was unexplored and virtually unsampled before our highly successful OASIS cruises. Geophysical, observational, and preliminary geochemical data from this nearly continuous chain of volcanoes led us to unexpected discoveries about their construction and revealed extreme compositional variability in the near MOR mantle that was previously only surmised from regional seamount studies in the northeast Pacific. The location, orientation, and preliminary data from the 820'N seamount chain make it an ideal a natural laboratory to investigate source heterogeneity and melting systematics in the near-ridge mantle. We propose to study the petrologic processes and mantle sources feeding MOR and near-axis volcanoes though comprehensive geochemical analyses of lavas and melt inclusions from the 820?N seamounts. Site-specific sampling using HOV Alvin and extensive, fine-scale mapping with AUV Sentry along the seamount chain, coupled with our previous comprehensive investigations of the 8- 10N EPR provide an exceptional opportunity to constrain geodynamic and geochemical models of mantle melting near MOR and determine the extent and length scales of mantle heterogeneity. We propose to collect a wide spectrum of petrologic and geochemical data including Sr, Nd, Pb, and Os isotopes, melt inclusion compositions, volatile contents, and 40Ar/39Ar age dates of lavas from the extensive collection of samples we have from the 820?N seamount chain. These results will be combined with numerical models to produce a petrologic model of mantle melting and magmatic processes in the near-ridge mantle. This extensive off-axis seamount chain provides a rare opportunity to probe the compositions of the mantle near MOR and to understand how magmas are spatially and temporally distributed in the shallow mantle and crust. Results from this research have implications for the generation of the majority of Earth?s crust.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The projects used to deliver this experience are highly interdisciplinary, allowing students to be exposed to the forefront of science and engineering.  The activities can be generally categorized into one (or more) of four broad categories: energy generation (e.g., solar cells, magnetic shape-memory alloys, thermoelectrics), energy storage (e.g., sodium-ion batteries, building systems), energy conservation (e.g., carbon nanoelectronics), or other societal challenges associated with materials processing-modeling-characterization (e.g., materials genome initiative).  Participants have their own individualized projects but are also integrated within a campus-wide interdisciplinary summer research community, training them to both communicate effectively across disciplines and more clearly understand the concepts central to their own work.  Students also participate in a number of supplemental workshops on lab safety, library resources, intellectual property, ethics, and communication; and they ultimately present their results at the annual Idaho Conference on Undergraduate Research (ICUR).  A comprehensive assessment program is used to gauge the learning and growth of participants as well as their confidence, satisfaction with the REU experience, and the factors which influence their perceptions of the lab environment and research generally.

Wildfires emit pollutants into the air creating poor air quality that is hazardous to people?s health and the environment.  Communities use results from high resolution global scale simulations of wildfire smoke to prepare for poor air quality. This project will quantify the uncertainty in operational smoke forecasts due to incomplete knowledge of the smoke plume, wind and other weather conditions.  Uncertainty estimates provide a more complete understanding of smoke forecasts, and can be communicated along with the predictions. These estimates have the potential to improve weather prediction models that are affected by smoke, and planning efforts by rural and downstream communities. This project will support two graduate students and one undergraduate student per year for each year of the three year project. <br/><br/>Weak constraint four dimensional data assimilation (4DVAR) will be implemented to combine wind field, emission and concentration data with a partial differential equation that describes transport of PM2.5 concentrations generated by wildfire smoke. Data from numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, including NCEP and EMCWF, smoke emission models from NOAA and US Forest service, and concentration data from EPA will be used.  The representer method will be developed for 4DVAR to reduce the search space for the optimal estimates from the state space to the data space.  The computational cost of 4DVAR will be further improved by developing algorithmic advances for adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) in parallel with storage and checkpointing of adjoints.  Approximation of the Dirac delta distributions, appearing in the adjoint method, will be improved with a new formulation inspired by the Immersed Boundary Method.   Estimates of PM2.5 concentration, wind field and emission estimates arising in the transport model will fit observations within specified error covariances.

Geophysical imaging is used to ""see"" the unseen critical zone underneath the surface. However, the acquired geophysical images need to be translated into physical properties such as density, moisture content, and chemical composition that are understandable and usable to other scientists.

The purpose of this research program is to uncover these hidden mechanisms and fully understand rust by using state-of-the-art instruments that allow us to see metals rust in liquids at the nanometer scale. By understanding the complex interplay between a material and its environment, transformative outcomes include an a priori approach for predicting and assessing corrosion, and a fundamental framework enabling engineers to design materials with superior corrosion resistance. Being able to control rust has far-reaching implications, from enabling ultra-light alloy design for aerospace applications, to materials for critical infrastructure, such as power generation, transportation, communications, defense, and water and waste treatment facilities. An integrated education plan extends the impact of this research by educating the next generation of corrosion engineers. Educational activities will benefit students from high school to graduate school, while providing opportunities for underserved and minority students to contribute to solving problems of national significance.  <br/> <br/>Technical Summary<br/><br/>Engineers design and process most engineering alloys to precipitate secondary phases; while these phases strengthen the alloy, they also act as the thermodynamic driving force for corrosion initiation. Inherent corrosion resistance can be tailored by selecting alloy constituents and processing routes to optimize fundamental electrochemical properties, but the appropriate constituents and processing routes are known only for select material systems and perform only under specific environmental conditions. How to expand beyond these systems to other materials and environments is still a tedious trial-and-error process. To address this limitation and advance the fundamental science needed to design for superior corrosion performance, this research connects the electrode potential of magnesium-lithium (Mg-Li) alloys in solution to their electronic structure by integrating state-of-the-art scanning Kelvin probe force microscopy (SKPFM) and scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) with first principles electronic property simulations. Using SKPFM to measure Volta potential (a surface electronic property) provides an experimental link spanning atomic structure and macroscale electrochemical properties via the work function. In complement, SECM quantifies the surface reaction kinetics during corrosion. Altogether, this research provides a new theoretical framework for relating local composition and structure to electrochemical properties--a critical factor governing material operational lifetimes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research focuses on two research-based strategies for improving students? mathematics achievement. The first, Explicit Attention to Concepts, draws students? attention specifically to the meaning of mathematical ideas while making connections between different ways to represent the content. The second, Students? Opportunities to Struggle, helps students make sense of graspable new concepts through supported problem solving with peers, highlighting ways to overcome confusion, stimulate personal sense-making, build perseverance, and promote openness to challenge. The work builds on prior investigations of how the two instructional strategies can be sequenced to promote student learning in middle grades mathematics, and an experimental research design will be used to compare outcomes of two promising professional development models for supporting rural teachers? adoption and adaptation of instructional strategies for their classrooms.<br/><br/>The project has five key features for building scientific understanding of effective mathematics instruction in rural settings. First, the project brings together rural teachers to foster authentic community around shared work of improving student learning. Second, professional learning and instructional support for teachers promote adoption and implementation of effective instructional practices in the crucial settings of grades 6-8 mathematics classrooms. Third, the project centers shared responsibility and autonomy through a statewide teacher-researcher alliance structure. Fourth, the project studies two high quality math professional development structures at scale for rural teachers: at-a-distance professional development facilitated by a centralized specialist, and in-person professional development facilitated by a local teacher-leader. Finally, the nested mixed methods research design compares the two professional development approaches across a range of outcomes including teachers? beliefs and instructional practices, as well as growth in their students? engagement and learning in mathematics. The experiment includes randomized assignment of middle grades mathematics teachers (N = 90 teachers, 20,000 students) to professional development conditions, with control procedures for sampling, quality of professional development, and cycles of classroom-based instructional improvement. Dissemination will reach local, state, and national teacher education communities, and materials and findings will support future adoption of assets-based, teacher-centered research and development partnerships.

Within the United States, pyroclastic surges are a potential hazard in many areas such as the Southwest and along the Cascade Range of the Pacific Northwest. Understanding parameters such as speed, pressure, temperature, and particle concentration is necessary to predict pyroclastic surge hazards and to take mitigative measures. Measurements of active pyroclastic surges are essentially impossible because of  their unpredictability and the extreme conditions they create.  As a result, we must use indirect methods:  (1) detailed study of the deposits that were produced by pyroclastic surges, which can be studied after a volcano has gone quiet; (2) experiments aimed at replicating some aspects of the surges; and (3) computer modeling of the flows.  This project uses these three methods iteratively. The work will provide new insights and tools to use in forecasting and mitigating volcanic hazards.  In addition, the work will be done by a diverse, newly-formed multi-university team, will train two new Ph.D. students, and will strengthen partnership between academic researchers with the U.S. Geological Survey, which has primary responsibility for hazard assessment.<br/><br/>Controls on the development of local facies in pyroclastic surge deposits as well as  larger-scale parameters such as proximal-to-distal facies variations, runout, and damage potential are poorly understood.  We will address the following research questions: (1) At the local scale (e.g., individual outcrop or group of outcrops), what are the relationships of bed forms and facies to sedimentation from suspended load, bed load flux, and local topography?  (2) At the large scale (proximal to distal), what are the roles of sedimentation, topography, initial temperature, mass flux, and atmospheric entrainment on large-scale facies distribution, runout distance, and damage potential? The proposed work includes three components. (1) Detailed field studies will focus on two well-preserved, young deposits (Ubehebe volcano, California; Crater Elegante, Sonora), with documentation of facies, grainsize, and componentry as functions of distance from vent and local topographic setting. (2) Experiments will test and extend a simple relationship between dune-form parameters measurable in the field, bed load flux, and suspended load sedimentation flux. (3) Multiphase numerical modeling will use adaptive mesh refinement to resolve fluxes near the bed, will improve the numerical solution of coupling between gas and very fine ash (key for surge transport and deposition), and will use unstructured mesh technology to model surge transport over complex natural terrains.  A new multiphase modeling tool that results from the project will be available for the research community at large.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Before children can speak, they feel emotions such as anger, joy, curiosity, and frustration and these emotions act as internal and external signals as they learn what words mean. For example, a child might show frustration when a caregiver does not understand what the child is saying, which in turn helps the child change what they understand a word or phrase to mean or how it is pronounced. The setting in which child language learning takes place is co-located where children are in the same physical location as the people they are learning language from, and the learning is through the communicative medium of spoken interaction. The information sources, emotions, and spoken interaction setting for children are in direct contrast to how machines learn language, which usually involves some kind of computational model that is given large amounts of text to learn from. This project aims to take inspiration from how children learn language in order to understand how to improve the models and methods of machines that learn language. Improved language learning in machines will enable machines to communicate with people more quickly, clearly, safely, and in ways that lower barriers for people to use complex technology with a natural spoken language interface. <br/><br/>This CAREER project examines a novel approach for computer systems to learn spoken language that will advance a theoretical model and improve how people and systems communicate. Research will improve language modeling in natural language processing by taking inspiration from how children learn language: they interact with others to learn words that denote physical entities and events, and, like all humans, often respond emotionally and embody how they feel in their behavior, whereas researchers currently largely train language models only on static text. The research team will use two robotic platforms for the research and significantly enrich model efficacy and will add knowledge of emotion by modeling it based on human perceptions of robot behaviors. The team will add embodied knowledge by grounding into vision and robot states, and finally, the team will train and evaluate a robot that uses the language model as it interacts with humans to learn language from them. The study will also result in two important datasets: robot behaviors with accompanying descriptions of those behaviors and emotion labels, and longitudinal data of robots interacting and learning language from humans. The objectives are to (1) Model emotion; test, and refine through interaction, (2) Develop a unified language model, and (3) Engage people and robots that learn language with emotional content.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the CISE/IIS/Robust Intelligence Program and the NSF Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Biological ice nucleators control the transition of water from liquid to solid ice crystals in all these contexts.  Biological ice nucleators can induce frost damage in plants, but can also promote vegetation growth by enabling rainfall.  They impact surface water, the hydrological cycle, and climate. Understanding the how biological ice nucleators control ice formation is critical for climate models, weather prediction, and decision-making in landscape design and agriculture. Despite this importance, the molecular mechanisms behind biologically enabled freezing remain largely elusive. This project seeks to decipher the superiority of proteins as ice makers and mitigators, surpassing all other substances. This knowledge would enable breakthroughs in understanding key parts of the ecosystem we inhabit, with urgently needed input for cryopreservation, environmentally benign de-icing, and updated climate models. New freezing technologies are also particularly important as the U.S. increasingly pursues activities in the Arctic, where ice can be a logistical burden or an operational enabler. Current ice-related challenges disproportionally affect rural agricultural and subsistence-based communities. This project aims to enhance rural student engagement in STEM by fostering greater awareness and interest through service-learning and the use of modern media and to help the communities develop environmentally friendly capacities to better predict, navigate and mitigate ice-associated challenges in a changing world.  <br/><br/>Pure water does not freeze at 0 C owing to the energy barrier associated with forming the initial crystallization nucleus. In nature, water usually freezes in a heterogeneous process, facilitated by the presence of particles that serve as ice nucleators. Bacterial ice-nucleating proteins (INP) are the best-known ice nucleators, enabling ice formation at temperatures close to 0 C. The control biological INPs exert over the phase transition of water has direct relevance for disciplines as diverse as cryobiology, plant pathology, biomedical engineering, and climate science. Despite their importance, the structures and working mechanisms behind INP-mediated freezing remain unknown. Progress toward answering the question of what makes INPs so much better at nucleating ice than any other material requires a molecular picture of the structures and interactions that enable superior ice nucleation in their natural environment. The main research objectives of this project are: 1) Elucidate how superior bacterial ice nucleators nucleate ice, 2) Unravel the correlation between ice-nucleating abilities and assembly of ice-binding units into large functional domains 3) Develop a biomimetic approach to ice nucleation by incorporating ice-binding proteins as building blocks. This research will allow the derivation of structure-function relationships and optimal functionalities of biogenic ice nucleators, and will enable the development of tunable materials that can act as antifreeze or ice nucleating agents depending on the assembly state. Integrated educational initiatives will utilize innovative media outreach and service-learning programs targeted at rural communities to ignite a transformative awareness of STEM opportunities, and to enable opportunities to collectively discover effective and environmentally benign solutions for ice control.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To do so, the proposed work will develop a new cross-domain simulation framework to enable accurate co-simulation of key physical parameters, such as wireless power harvesting and electrode properties, with integrated circuit design to optimize the design of microscale neural interface systems. Next, small-area, low-power circuit design techniques for neural stimulation and recording will be developed. The stimulation circuitry will guarantee chronically safe operation without off-chip components by adaptively monitoring and controlling the electrode interface. The recording circuitry will employ precisely-timed memoryless sampling to be resilient to saturating interference from neural stimulation.

Wildfire risk can be significantly reduced by three types of pre-event household hazard adjustments?mitigation, preparedness to stay, defend, and survive, and readiness to evacuate. However, the factors that influence the adoption of these hazard adjustments remain poorly understood. Existing wildfire evacuation models rarely consider fire spread dynamics; lack trilateral integration of people, fire hazard, and traffic components; and are based on limited social-behavioral data. To address these knowledge gaps, this project will integrate behavioral data with active learning and goal-setting techniques for increasing WUI residents? adoption of pre-event hazard adjustments. In addition, social-behavioral data will be infused into transportation engineering models to create more accurate and actionable agent-based models (ABMs) for evacuation. To achieve these objectives, the researchers will collaborate with four WUI communities in three states to (1) identify factors influencing households? pre-event hazard adjustment adoption and evacuation decision-making for wildfire hazard, and (2) integrate social-behavioral data into wildfire evacuation scenarios using ABMs to evaluate alternative evacuation strategies. Regional planners and emergency managers will be engaged to test and evaluate evacuation protocols and educational programs. <br/><br/>This project will expand and strengthen the capability of the Protection Action Decision Model (PADM) to explain complex decision-making processes related to wildfire mitigation, stay/defend/survive preparedness, and evacuation readiness. Specifically, this project?s results will advance our knowledge in pre-event risk messaging about wildfire hazards and address the urgent need for incorporating multidimensional datasets in wildfire evacuation models. The study of four different WUI communities will allow assessment of the cross-population generalizability within and beyond the project?s study areas. The outcomes will lead to best practices for motivating households? protective actions, assessments of community-informed evidence-based strategies for wildfire evacuation modeling, testing of alternative wildfire warning messaging strategies, and, ultimately, reduction in wildfire risk to residents and businesses.

Plants evolve to produce new toxic chemicals while herbivores, and their associated microbial communities, change such that they become more tolerant to plant toxins. The understanding of plant toxins and herbivore tolerance is important for conservation biologists that manage native herbivores and plants, for the ranching and agricultural community that rely on plants to feed livestock and chemicals to defend crops from pests, and the medical community that relies on plant-derived chemicals to manage human health. A better understanding of these important plant-herbivore systems will require the expertise of many scientists with different specializations that must cooperate across state boundaries. This project will leverage, build, and integrate research and education strengths across Idaho, Nevada, and Wyoming to identify the Genomes Underlying Toxin Tolerance (GUTT) in vertebrate herbivores. The GUTT team will integrate a range of expertise to identify how variation in toxin tolerance influences populations of wild mammalian and avian herbivores. The team will work with high school teachers and use Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences in introductory biology, chemistry, and math courses to train, inspire, recruit, and retain a diverse workforce capable of applying genetic understanding of toxin tolerance in animals and microbes to conservation, agriculture and human health. The project will also connect GUTT participants with local agency and industry partners to diversify career and funding opportunities for faculty and students. The research and educational activities will increase the capacity for Idaho, Nevada, and Wyoming faculty, students, and community partners to more effectively manage toxic plants and the animals and microbes that interact with these plants.<br/><br/>Technical Description<br/>This project identifies the Genomes Underlying Toxin Tolerance (GUTT) by establishing the links between molecular and physiological mechanisms of toxin tolerance that predict demographic consequences in vertebrate herbivores. The researchers use metabolomics, transcriptomics, metagenomics, and molecular modeling to identify molecular interactions between herbivore and gut microbial genomes and toxic chemicals ingested by herbivores. The team will use  in vivo and in vitro experiments to quantify physiological mechanisms of toxin tolerance and physiological consequences of toxin exposure. Participants will also work on manipulating molecular and physiological mechanisms of toxin tolerance to develop, validate, and iteratively refine models that predict how toxin exposure influences herbivore demography. The research will result in: 1) An unprecedented, detailed view of concerted herbivore and microbial response to, and modification of, toxins in the herbivore gut that influence demographic rates of native vertebrate herbivores; 2) Discovery and archiving of chemical, genetic, and microbial diversity from unique interactions created in the guts of mammalian and avian herbivores consuming diverse plant chemicals; and 3) Workforce development programs that create and sustain a culture of inclusion for marginalized groups across all career stages who can innovate and lead new frontiers in integrated research and educational practices. High school outreach programs and interactions with predominantly undergraduate institutions will be used to inspire the next generation of scientists. Rentention of these students will be ensured through Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences throughout the undergraduate curriculum where students use genetic and chemical data to discover novel mechanisms and consequences of toxin tolerance.

Previous studies in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica suggest that viral infections of microbes, and a general lack of fertilizers (i.e., nutrients), may be important factors shaping the development and functioning of microbial communities in cryoconite holes.  The researchers propose an experimental approach to understand how nutrient limitation affects diversity (number of species) and overall abundance of microbes, and how the diversity and abundance of microbes in turn affects the diversity, abundance, and infection type of viruses that parasitize the microbes in cryoconite sediments.  The researchers will use sediments previously collected from Antarctic glaciers that have varying concentrations of viruses and nutrients, to set up a nutrient-addition experiment to determine how nutrients affect microbial and viral population dynamics. The results will deepen our understanding of how microbial communities in general are shaped by nutrients and viruses and give new insights into the functioning of viruses in extremely cold environments. The researchers will publish their findings in scientific journals and will share their discoveries with K-12 students from rural schools in collaboration with the Pinhead Institute and will connect undergraduate students from under-represented minorities to polar research through participation in the university?s Science, Technology, Engineering & Mathematics Routes Uplift Research Program. Outreach will be achieved through videos produced and distributed by a professional science communicator. The research advances a National Science Foundation goal of expanding fundamental knowledge of Antarctic systems, biota, and processes by utilizing the unique characteristics of the Antarctic region as a science observing platform. <br/><br/>The Principal Investigators propose an experimental approach to understand how nutrient limitation affects microbial diversity and abundances and their cascading effects on virus diversity, abundance, and mode of infection (lysis vs. lysogeny) in Antarctic cryoconite holes. Cryoconite holes are ideal natural microcosms for manipulative studies, not available in other cryospheric ecosystems.  The PIs will use previously collected cryoconite from across a gradient of both viral diversity and nutrient levels to address questions about key limiting nutrients and microbial-viral community dynamics in cryoconite sediments. Nutrient manipulation experiments will be conducted in a growth chamber that closely approximates the light and temperature regime of in situ cryoconite holes to test three core hypotheses: (1) phosphorus availability limits microbial productivity and abundance in cryoconite holes; (2) relaxing nutrient limitation in cryoconite from low-diversity glaciers will increase species diversity, leading microbial communities to resemble those found on more nutrient-rich glaciers; (3) relaxing nutrient limitation will increase the diversity and abundance of viruses by increasing the availability of suitable hosts, and decrease the prevalence of lysogenic infections.  By manipulating nutrient limitation within a realistic range, this project will help verify hypothesized phosphorus limitation of Antarctic cryoconite holes and will extend understanding of the connections between nutrients, diversity, and viral infection dynamics in the cryosphere more generally. A better understanding of these dynamics in cryoconite sediments improves the ability of scientists to forecast future impacts of environmental changes in the cryosphere.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These aquifers are characterized by complex groundwater recharge, storage, and flow patterns in sinkholes, pores, fractures, and conduits. In many mountainous areas of the western U.S. and worldwide that host karst aquifers, most of the annual precipitation falls in the winter as snow. In these snow-dominated karst watersheds, snowmelt recharges aquifers that sustain streamflow in summer when precipitation is scarce and water demand is high. These watersheds are sensitive to year-to-year variations and long-term trends in precipitation and temperature. This creates challenges for sustainable water resource management particularly when a quantitative understanding of mountainous karst watershed response to climate variability is lacking. Such knowledge gaps exist due to complex recharge and discharge processes that occur because of topographical and geological heterogeneities inherent in these watersheds. This project will overcome these limitations and provide a sound scientific basis for improved water resources management. Funding will support both graduate and undergraduate research at multiple universities. Through outreach and educational activities, the project will also engage local stakeholders, the general public, and K-12 students.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of the proposed research is to understand and predict hydrologic responses of snow-dominated mountainous karst aquifers. The three-year project will integrate a spatially distributed, physically based snowmelt model with a data-driven, deep learning model that represents the highly complex karst aquifer system. Field observational and geochemical data sets (including streamflow, and ions and isotopes in stream and spring water) will be collected at various spatial and time scales to identify recharge and discharge characteristics, while also testing the predictive capability and physical representativeness of the deep learning model. Specifically, the project will (1) quantify the spatiotemporal groundwater discharge and streamflow response to snowmelt/rainfall events with varying intensity and duration, (2) determine how interannual climate variability and watershed physical properties influence hydrologic behavior, and (3) test the combined physically based and data-driven modeling approach in different locations and climate conditions. The outcomes will lead to improved understanding of how snow-dominated mountainous karst watersheds respond to climate variability and provide insight into the robustness of the modeling approach for forecasting or transferability to other regions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Achieving this goal requires new, efficient approaches that mimic an array of complex mechanisms observed in biology. Chief among these are the rules governing changes in the strength of connections between neurons. Synaptic connection strengths are believed to be ultimately responsible for memory, reasoning, perception, and other higher-order functions. A combination of established and emerging semiconductor device and circuit technologies will be used in this project to investigate networks with biologically-realistic learning. Integrated education and outreach activities will enhance understanding and awareness of biological and electronic neural networks for middle and high school students, regionally and nationally. <br/><br/>This CAREER award supports the development of electronic spiking neural networks (SNNs) that capture the dynamic synaptic learning modalities found in the brain. Circuit blocks with short-term memory will be used in conjunction with devices that change electrical resistance over longer periods to achieve synaptic learning that depends on spiking frequency as well as individual spike times. A primary objective is the design, fabrication, and testing of a neuro-synaptic architecture with learning rates tunable over a range of milliseconds to hours. The physical system will then be used to study cognitive tasks that combine classical conditioning and spatio-temporal pattern recognition. Sensitivity of the network to device variations and control parameters will be examined in terms of pattern recognition accuracy, power consumption, and stability. Benchmarks will also be applied to quantify system performance relative to other techniques.

Even though poor skeletal health is a major cause of injury and disability among aged individuals, the reason for reduced bone-building responsiveness to exercise in older individuals, compared to younger individuals, remains a knowledge gap. This project will quantify the mechanical forces that cells are subjected to in bone by using novel 3D printed tissue engineering constructs. Combining this technology with the aging conditions caused by microgravity in experiments to be conducted on the International Space Station will reveal the putative connections between aging and physical activity at the cellular level. Ultimately, these efforts may lead to non-pharmacologic, regenerative strategies to improve muscle and bone health in in older adults, in those who must undergo extended bedrest, and astronauts. The multidisciplinary approach taken in this bioengineering project will be an excellent platform to fascinate and engage the next generation of students and young scientists.<br/><br/>A major technical barrier in studying the mechanical environment of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that reside within bone marrow is that there are no model systems currently available that can replicate the mechanical complexity of the bone marrow compartment. To close this gap, this work will develop a 3D printed bone marrow analog system that combines an in vivo environment with the accessibility of an in vitro culture system. This will permit a systematic approach of study. To study cellular mechanical environments within these marrow analogs, the approach will include an experimental setup and a complementary and validated finite element model. These mechanoactive marrow environments will provide a novel tool for mechanobiologists to systematically study the effect of the mechanical environment on cell responses in 3D. Utilization of this novel system in this project will specifically advance mechanobiology knowledge by: (1) quantifying the mechanoresponse of old MSCs in a young bone marrow geometry and vice versa, thereby identifying the contribution of mechanical stress environment to the mechanosignaling capacity of aged MSCs.

These data-driven approaches transition from the classical techniques of human-engineered source code to algorithms trained on a dataset to produce the desired solution, placing the data in the driver's seat. The proliferation of these data-driven technologies is being enabled and hastened by new hardware and software systems specifically designed to support the complex data-driven computation associated with these algorithms and the massive volumes of data accompanying them. But despite the impressive performance gains of these new hardware and software systems, understanding their design's data component has languished in favor of performance-driven advances in software and hardware-based solutions.

Understanding how fast, if ever, native plant populations can recover from wildfire, and where recruitment of prior dominants is not occurring will aid efforts to restore degraded ecosystems. Plant population recovery is most often studied by marking and measuring individual plants in field plots or along 50 to 100 m transects. Logistical considerations limit the spatial coverage of these types of field measurements, resulting in a mismatch between multi-kilometer-scale wildfires and plot level responses. The research proposed here will use drones to develop new methods to measure plant population recovery over large areas. These methods will include computer algorithms to detect and distinguish individual plants in aerial imagery, and statistical models to quantify drone-detected plants' growth, survival, and reproduction. This quantitative framework will enable the research team to study how an ecologically important dominant plant species across the inter-mountain west is responding to wide spread fire and to large-scale environmental variation within the vast burned areas. The research will be applied to forecast population recovery of big sagebrush plants, a species with critical ecological importance. The results will aid land management across this vast region by advancing drone technology to monitor post-fire recovery.<br/> <br/>Novel remote sensing data from unoccupied aerial systems (UAS) could aid spatial models for plant demography by providing imagery with fine enough resolution to detect individual plants across large spatial extents. This project will develop a framework to infer plant demographic rates from UAS imagery by coupling computer vision techniques with hierarchical Bayesian models. The research will focus on spatial population dynamics of big sagebrush, Artemisia tridentata, a species with high conservation value in the American West. As wildfires decimate sagebrush habitat, landscape recovery depends on whether big sagebrush can recolonize disturbed areas. However, like most low-statured plants, our understanding of big sagebrush demography is almost entirely derived from meter-scale field plots, limiting extrapolation to large spatial scales. The research will develop a reproducible workflow to identify individual plants in UAS imagery, quantify demographic rates of plants while accounting for imperfect detection in aerial imagery, and determine the impacts of spatial covariates on sagebrush demography. This research will advance quantitative modeling approaches for spatial plant demography with immediate application to an imperiled ecosystem.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While the nutrients underneath glaciers are known to be important for nearby biological communities, comparatively less is known about the chemistry and importance of glacier surfaces and snowpack, which can trap dust -  small particles of rock that are deposited by wind and with snowfall. The dust is darker than ice and snow and therefore can warm during sunny periods and melt the surrounding frozen water, generating small amounts of liquid water. During cloudy and cold periods, solar radiation can no longer heat the particles and the liquid water around the dust freezes again. These thawing and freezing cycles can break down the dust and release nutrients, such as iron, which can potentially be used by organisms in the ice or can be transported to streams, lakes, and/or the ocean during periods of high melt. This research will combine computer modeling and laboratory experiments to understand 1) what happens (chemically and physically) to glacier and snowpack dust during freezing and thawing and 2) how to model freezing and thawing of water and dust in glacier ice. Two traveling exhibits exploring the connections between science and art will result from this project, allowing for diverse audiences to connect with the Antarctic continent and understand how small-scale science influences large-scale systems. The results of this study will determine the geochemistry of glacial meltwater due to freezing and thawing, and whether the meltwater contains critical nutrients for surrounding ecosystems.<br/><br/>Despite low temperatures and the relative scarcity of liquid water, glacial systems can be a major source of trace metals, nutrients and other weathering products to proglacial and marine systems. While the importance of weathering has been established in subglacial and proglacial environments, less is understood about weathering mechanisms or the composition of major and trace nutrients at the most upstream source: within snow and supraglacial ice. Wind deposits fine-grained sediment on ice surfaces, which can then melt or become incorporated into the ice profile and experience a range of thermal regimes and freeze-thaw conditions. Daily freeze-thaw cycling drives physical and chemical weathering of sediment grains, yet few studies have explicitly examined the frequency and intensity of freeze-thaw cycles and how they control major ion and trace metal release, alteration, and mobility. This interdisciplinary study will use geochemical and energy balance modeling, freeze-thaw experimentation, and scanning electron microscopy to advance knowledge of mineral weathering in ice and snow active layers. Existing samples collected from the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica, an ecosystem that relies on runoff derived from supraglacial ice and snow melt, will be utilized.

Still, what caused the warming and how it affected plants and animals remains unclear. This project uses plant fossils preserved in lake sediments in Washington, Idaho and Oregon to study how ecosystems changed during the MMCO. Specifically, the researchers will investigate whether CO2 (a greenhouse gas) emitted from Pacific Northwest (PNW) volcanoes during the mid-Miocene helped heat the atmosphere, how climate changed in the PNW, and how local plant communities adjusted to these changes. Mid-Miocene ecosystems were similar to today; therefore, learning about the MMCO helps predict what may happen to today's ecosystems experiencing climate change. Several graduate and undergraduate students are being trained, and a new display featuring MMCO research in the Burke Museum is being created. <br/><br/>This project examines the causes and effects of mid-Miocene warming through the study of 18 exceptional PNW paleofloras from before, during and after the MMCO. Together, the floras form a sequence of linked data on atmospheric pCO2, regional climate change, and vegetation that can be precisely dated. The floras often preserve macrofossils, pollen, and phytoliths, providing an integrated view of local and regional climate and vegetation. Project aims are to: (1) do high-precision U-Pb geochronology on volcanic ashes at 13 floral sites across the MMCO; (2) study plant assemblages at all 18 sites to infer (a) vegetation composition, diversity, structure, and successional stage, (b) local-regional climate, and (c) atmospheric pCO2; and (3) use these data to evaluate the nature and timing of PNW ecosystem change during the MMCO.

The Green River Formation in the western U.S. offers an especially valuable record of the most geologically recent period of prolonged greenhouse conditions, which occurred approximately 50-53 million years ago during the Eocene Epoch.  It is famous for its rich assemblages of fossil vertebrates, insects, and plants, and for containing the world's largest commercial deposits of soda ash and oil shale.  This research project will focus on evidence for repeated rapid warming events during this time, by examining how river courses changed, the types of sediment that accumulated within the lake, and variations in ancient soil development and chemistry.  Equally important, this study will build a time scale of unprecedented accuracy and precision for these important deposits, based on new radiometric dates of volcanic ash in the lake, the chronology of changes in the Earth's magnetic field, and sedimentation patterns that were driven by periodic oscillations in the Earth's rotation and orbit.  Broader impacts of this proposal will include development of local 2-hour field trips for middle and high school students, enhanced through the use of innovative data visualization technology on portable devices.   <br/><br/>The Early Eocene Climatic Optimum (EECO) was a time of persistent global warmth, of which the cause remains incompletely determined.  Lake deposits of the Green River Formation preserve a rich and previously untapped record that complements that contained in marine sediments, and present an opportunity to advance the precision and accuracy of the Early Eocene timescale.  This project is an integrated, multidisciplinary investigation focused on one of the world's richest and best studied systems of ancient lake strata. The research will investigate three principal questions: 1. How did the timing of terrestrial warming compare to that inferred from the marine record, and to predicted patterns of the Earth's orbital variations?  Recent advances in radioisotopic dating can be used to directly test the relationship of warming events to Earth's orbital changes, and calibrate dynamic gravitational models of the solar system back to ca. 50 million years. 2. How did temperatures, seasonality, hydrologic cycling, and weathering on land evolve during the EECO? One hypothesis is that warming was amplified on continents relative to the oceans and was accompanied by more equable temperatures year-round, whereas precipitation seasonality and intensity increased. 3. How did the complex tectonic and magmatic evolution of western North America impact the preservation of EECO climate signals?  The research will test the hypothesis that repeated, stepwise drainage reorganizations within the tectonically-active uplands modified the hydrologic balance and sedimentary deposits of the Eocene lake environment and its response to orbital changes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Effective infrastructure provides a strong foundation for socioeconomic vitality and broad quality of life improvement. Strong, reliable, and effective infrastructure spurs private-sector innovation, grows the economy, creates jobs, makes public-sector service provision more efficient, strengthens communities, promotes equal opportunity, protects the natural environment, enhances national security, and fuels American leadership. To achieve these goals requires expertise from across the science and engineering disciplines. SAI focuses on how knowledge of human reasoning and decision-making, governance, and social and cultural processes enables the building and maintenance of effective infrastructure that improves lives and society and builds on advances in technology and engineering.<br/><br/>The electricity system within the U.S. is undergoing rapid changes. It is incorporating higher levels of wind and solar energy sources, responding to more variable demand, and preparing for large climate and weather uncertainties. Yet, decisions about resource procurement, investment, and contingency planning are often made with limited information about tradeoffs between resource costs and reliability risks or the unequal impacts of power grid reliability across communities and social settings. This SAI planning project examines how the transition to a reliable future electric grid can be made more efficient, sustainable, and equitable. It considers how the engineering metrics and models for resource adequacy are embedded in decision-making practices and relationships between organizations. The project focuses on the co-design of resource adequacy approaches, with partnerships involving industry actors, regulators and electric grid stakeholders in a region of the country where the relationships between power reliability, affordability, and sustainability are at the forefront of legislative and regulatory agendas. <br/><br/>This SAI planning project establishes an integrated framework, a set of transformative concepts and analytical tools, and an interdisciplinary collaborative team to further a fundamental rethinking of approaches for power grid reliability. The project develops a new framework for power-grid resource adequacy assessment by focusing on two long-term research questions. One is a consideration of how institutional design choices and rules structuring governance arrangements enable or constrain learning and innovation. The other focuses on how quantitative and predictive modeling of resource adequacy and power shutoff contingencies can better incorporate differences across spatial and social settings in assumptions and attitudes about risks, costs, fairness, environmental impacts, and climate change mitigation. The planning activity combines stakeholder-engaged conceptualization and data collection, semi-structured interviews, pilot testing of analytical tools and approaches to uncertainty in coupled human-technical systems, and team building activities. These efforts provide a foundation for research on resource adequacy using new concepts for understanding institutional design choices in electricity system governance, novel analytical tools for characterizing the risks and uncertainties posed by rapid technological and climate change, and new metrics and modeling tools for assessing the affordability, reliability, sustainability, and equity of decisions.<br/><br/>This award is supported by the Directorate for Social, Behavioral, and Economic (SBE) Sciences and the Directorate for Engineering.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Industry, government, the public, professional associations, and accreditation organizations are increasingly demanding that engineers consider sustainability and resiliency during the design process. Sustainable designs balance economic, ecological, and societal needs by being responsive to community impact, public health, and the environment. Resilient designs are durable: in adverse situations, they continue to function, resist damage, and recover quickly. This project is driven by the need for engineers who can design solutions that maximize societal benefit while minimizing costs and environmental impacts.  In other words, the next generation of engineers needs the skills to produce sustainable and resilient solutions to engineering design problems. To help students develop these skills, the project plans to develop a set of active learning modules that integrate sustainable and resilient design concepts.  These modules will be deployed in existing upper and lower division courses across multiple engineering degree programs.  This project has the potential to help equip the next generation of engineering professionals with the ability to create design solutions that benefit the economy, environment, and society.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to transform undergraduate engineering education by instilling sustainable and resilient design concepts in electrical, materials, mechanical, and civil engineering, and in construction management curricula. A new junior-level interdisciplinary engineering design course will be developed that emphasizes the importance of these design concepts through project-based learning and that advances the used of sustainable and resilient design in multiple disciplines. The project team will develop and implement active learning modules for engineering design courses. The project will address the following research questions: (1) How do active learning modules focused on sustainable and resilient design affect students? knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors towards these topics and their relevance to professional engineering practice? (2) How well do students understand and manage the trade-offs associated with designing for sustainability and resiliency in engineering?  (3) How do approaches to sustainable and resilient design vary by engineering discipline? Guided by the Knowledge, Attitudes and Behaviors conceptual model, the study will use a mixed-methods approach to collect and analyze qualitative and quantitative data to address the research questions. The results of the project will be disseminated through an online repository that will include active learning modules, a strategic plan for implementation, and research results demonstrating the modules? effectiveness. In addition, a conference on sustainability and resiliency will be hosted to provide a venue for colleagues from multiple institutions to share their curricular activities and research.

Wildfires consume vegetation, releasing stored organic carbon as carbon dioxide (CO2), a greenhouse gas. Recently, however, the accumulation of salts in the form of soil carbonates (i.e., inorganic carbon) have been observed after dryland wildfires. The mechanisms of fire-induced carbonate accumulation (FICA) and its importance to long-term carbon storage remain unknown. This research begins to address a gap in our knowledge about the origin, fate, and impact of fire-induced soil carbonates as wildfire activity is at its historic highest levels in drylands. Here, researchers characterize the environmental controls on fire-induced carbonate accumulation using a prescribed rangeland fire slated for September 2023 in an already intensively instrumented catchment of the US Department of Agriculture?s Northwest Watershed Research Center (NWRC) and Critical Zone Observatory (CZO). The research is part of an interdisciplinary group of researchers and land managers collaborating to enhance understanding of wildland fires to create greater regional impact.<br/> <br/>This research will characterize the abiotic factors contributing to fire-induced carbonate accumulation (FICA) using an experimental fire in September 2023, located within the cold desert, sagebrush steppe ecosystem characteristic of southern Idaho and the surrounding region. A combination of factors including soil pH, calcium availability, soil carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration, and extracellular enzymatic activity appear to lead to FICA, but the exact mechanisms involved, and the source and fate of this carbon remain unresolved. Uncommon in rangeland wildfire studies, the project will 1) collect soil samples just before the fire, and contrast these with post-fire conditions to facilitate future investigation of controls on FICA, and 2) measure soil CO2, moisture, and temperature conditions before, during, and for 9 months after the fire ? a unique and perishable dataset, and something that has never been done to study the mechanisms driving carbonate formation caused by fires. Sample collection and sensor measurements will be stratified across north- and south-facing aspects, and burn severity treatments (i.e., vegetation types) to understand landscape controls on FICA. Soil samples are also considered perishable and will be archived for future investigation beyond initial pH, EC, and carbonate determination.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, their sounds have received little scientific study despite their utility in monitoring streamflow and their environmental significance as dominant features of the riparian soundscape. In this project, the investigators will build on preliminary work and develop a tool for helping researchers collect important but currently impractical discharge data. This project will create a monitoring method that can enable hydrologists to collect streamflow data more efficiently than is currently possible, removing the constraint of stream-gaging logistics on data collection and permitting studies that are currently impractical. To encourage widespread adoption of the method, they will release a mature, user-friendly sensor/software combination with comprehensive manuals and instructional videos demonstrating fieldwork and data processing for new users. All instrumentation and software produced in this project will be open-source. They will promote hydrological and STEM education at multiple levels by including undergraduate and graduate students in research, instrumentation construction, software development, and K-12 outreach to underserved schools and community organizations. This interdisciplinary project will help train student assistants to work across disciplinary boundaries and teach transferable skills including electronic design and maintenance, field data collection, analysis, and scientific communication.<br/><br/>The investigators will address two research questions: 1) how can acoustic monitoring of whitewater features be used to measure streamflow? 2) how does the spatial distribution of whitewater sounds depend on characteristics of the stream and surroundings? The investigators will address their first question with case studies of many scales, ranging from waterfalls on rivers to riffles on mountain streams. In particular, they will examine the utility of acoustics for recording low-order and intermittent streams, which are under-monitored despite their hydrological, ecological, and policy significance. To answer the second question, they will characterize whitewater soundscapes by  collecting snapshot spatial surveys of noise around whitewater features and assessing how discharge, whitewater feature characteristics, vegetation, and topography affect stream noise extent and intensity.  This question is relevant to wide-ranging communities including hydrologists (site selection for acoustic gaging), geophysicists (understanding a important and variable source of background noise), ecologists (stream sounds aiding wildlife as navigational beacons, or impairing their ability to hear predators or prey), and urban and recreational planners (background sounds have measurable health effects on humans).

As such, it is possible to remotely characterize these hazardous mud flows by tracking their flow positions and energetics through time.  This work seeks to develop infrasound analytical tools to locate where lahars initiate, how far and fast they move, and estimate their mass flow. Toward these goals the project will deploy and maintain seismic and infrasonic instruments at Fuego Volcano (Guatemala), where lahars are common during the rainy season (April through September).  Rain gauges and time lapse cameras will be installed at locations along the lahar paths to understand how lahars initiate and to validate flow characteristics through direct observation. Fuego volcano is an ideal candidate for this study because of its frequent lahars and relatively easy access and because information learned will be applicable for mitigating risks.  Lessons learned at Fuego may then be applied to dozens of volcanoes in the US and around the world where lahar activity is common.  The project aims to train several graduate and undergraduate students from the US and result in scientific publication. Important capacity building in Guatemala will result from the training of Guatemalan scientists and technology transfer to observatory staff. <br/><br/>This project will improve our understanding of the seismo-acoustic source mechanisms associated with lahars, and to develop methods that can be used to track such sources and other rapid gravity-driven mass movements.  Through multi-parametric observations this study will contribute to our fundamental understanding of how lahars are triggered during precipitation events and where material is incorporated along the lahar flow path.  Infra-acoustic arrays and broadband seismic sensors will be deployed at Fuego Volcano (Guatemala) with the intent to remotely monitor the most frequent channels that carry lahars during the rainy season.  Signal processing techniques using data from an integrated network of arrays will be used to track and quantify flow energetics.  Fuego provides an ideal field site where seismo-acoustic data will be combined with contemporaneous rainfall and geomorphologic (terrain and channel slope) observations.  Computer vision techniques will be used to quantify timing, mass flow, and velocities of lahars at various positions along channels.

ExTerra (Exhumed Terranes) is a broad US geosciences consortium that investigates rocks exhumed from fossil subduction zones - rocks whose evolution uniquely illuminates processes otherwise obscured beneath the surface of active subduction zones. ExTerra will partner with our sister European organization ZIP (Zooming In between Plates) using novel field institutes to promote collaborative research among US and European researchers focused on subduction zone processes. The E-FIRE project develops a new paradigm for collaborative geological research that focuses on collaborative field work to collect materials held communally, augmented by broad interactions through workshops and student exchanges. Each researcher contributes a different analytical expertise to a combined effort aimed at transforming our understanding of active subduction zone processes. International partnership is critical because European researchers actively investigating the geology of each field area will provide foundational field knowledge of the region and actively participate in analysis and interpretation with US researchers. The project will integrate students and post-doctoral scholars (Early-Stage Researchers, ESRs) into a developing international network of scientists, help train ESRs in research and education, and provide a model for future geoscience collaborations across disciplines.

For example, integration is used to mathematically express the total quantity of a substance, such as a hazardous chemical, over a given spatial region (or domain). However, the integration problems in these models can rarely be solved by pen and paper techniques, so researchers must employ numerical integration, or quadrature, methods. This project introduces an entirely new framework, Fredholm Alternative Quadrature (FAQ), for performing the essential task of quadrature. It thus gives researchers new effective options for tackling integration problems, especially those involving geometrically complicated domains and irregularly sampled data. The framework also offers a new approach to a classical subject that has been around for millennia, providing fresh insights and pedagogical opportunities. The project will support one Ph.D. student in the recently created computational math, science, & engineering (CMSE) program, which will also help bolster the research portfolio of this program. Building from a successful track record of recruiting graduate students in computational mathematics from underrepresented groups, the investigator will continue working with the Institute for Inclusive and Transformative Scholarship to help identify potential candidates for the project. New educational opportunities for undergraduate, master's, and Ph.D. students will also be created through the development of a Vertically Integrated Project (VIP) that incorporates topics from the project.<br/><br/>The FAQ framework is based on a relationship between the continuous Fredholm Alternative (FA) theorem for Poisson's equation and the discrete FA for linear systems that arise from discretizing this equation. It does not employ integration but instead requires discretizing certain Laplace operators at a given set of points over the integration domain and solving an eigenvalue problem. To maximize the flexibility and practicality of FAQ, the mesh-free radial basis function finite difference (RBF-FD) method for discretizing the Laplace operators will be used. This results in a method that 1) does not require explicitly or implicitly integrating basis functions, 2) can be used on geometrically complicated domains (even surfaces), 3) can be implemented for scattered samples of the integrand without meshing, 4) can yield high orders of accuracy for smooth functions, and 5) can be computed efficiently. Several numerical and theoretical advancements will also be made, including techniques for producing high-order accurate RBF-FD discretizations, efficient meshfree multilevel methods for computing the FAQ formulas, least squares techniques for enhancing the stability of FAQ formulas, tools for analyzing FAQ approximation properties, and new insights on classical quadrature formulas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In addition, as the Covid-19 pandemic highlighted, there is a need to develop virtual educational tools that provide comparable experiences for all students. <br/><br/>This project examines an innovative introduction to the chemistry lab experience by applying the use of virtual reality technology to chemistry education. The study will examine the extent to which VR and XR training modules can prepare students for entry to a chemistry lab course, reinforce conventional lab training, boost knowledge of chemistry literacy, and minimize anxiety associated with performing  experiments. The project goal is to deliver transformative experiences through XR technology that will positively impact the ability of undergraduates in first-year chemistry courses to engage with and persist in scientific settings. The project will employ an inclusive design-centered approach to the development of the XR modules, where extensive suggestions from students and other stakeholders will refine and improve the technology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, awareness of the reciprocal benefits of strong partnerships among science communities is lacking, and shared interests, community needs, and barriers to functional partnerships are not well defined. To overcome these gaps, a workshop will be held to develop recommendations on strengthening science community partnerships, and building pathways that speed the translation of research to innovations and enhance and expand inclusive and experiential training opportunities to prepare a diverse and globally competitive workforce. The workshop, led by two EPSCoR Jurisdictions (Idaho and Hawai?i), will consist of a series of national events facilitated by KnowInnovations: two free virtual Pre-Workshop MicroLabs for an unlimited number of participants and an In-Person Workshop for 120 selected participants representing diverse groups and organizations. Participants of the workshop will co-create the structures and processes that will inform how diverse organizations can support and collaborate on use-inspired research.  The products of the workshops will include white papers that highlight opportunities and challenges for expanding use-inspired research and building partnerships that will lead to the translation of basic biological research into societal impact. <br/><br/><br/>To maintain global leadership in science innovation, new processes are needed to improve collaborations among academic, private, and government science communities to facilitate the translation of basic research to innovation and to better inform evidence-based practices.

However, microbiomes are constantly changing through time and space. These changes can have big impacts on the health of animal or plant hosts and the functioning of entire ecosystems. For this reason, uncovering rules that govern how microbiomes change across time and space is essential for understanding how they affect their hosts and ecosystems. This project builds on previous understanding of different strategies used by microbes to survive and compete for resources and applies it to studying the ecosystem that forms in the ?pitchers? of the carnivorous pitcher plant, Sarracenia purpurea. Through a combination of experiments and modeling, the microbiome will be studied to determine how microbial community functions change over time, how the host plant influences microbiome formation, and how the microbiome affects the host plant. The results will be compared with other aquatic, plant- and soil-associated microbiomes, to understand how S. purpurea pitchers can be relevant models for understanding roles of microbiomes in larger ecosystems. The project will train the next generation of scientists in interdisciplinary skills. The researchers will involve undergraduate and graduate students including those who are under-represented in STEM research, train students in coding to develop a Sarracenia microbiome website for public education, develop K-12 educational modules, and present interactive public lectures.    <br/>  <br/>This project employs interdisciplinary approaches including molecular genetics, biochemistry, ecological modeling, multivariate statistics, and biogeography to characterize microbiome succession, functions and host interactions. It builds from the Yield-Acquisition-Stress (Y-A-S) predictive framework, which characterizes microbial life history strategies based on functional traits related to cell growth yield (Y), resource acquisition (A) and stress tolerance (S), with the microbiomes changing proportions of these strategies over time. The Y-A-S framework has yet to be applied to microbiome succession or functions important for host and ecosystem health. The project will determine dynamics of functional succession across climatic gradients using field-sampling of natural communities over broad biogeographical scales, test how host factors influence microbiome succession using experimental manipulations of natural pitcher communities, and examine microbiome effects on host fitness using experimental bacterial communities. A cutting-edge approach with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Random Forest models will be used to identify Y-A-S life strategies based on a trait matrix derived from metagenomes, RNA transcripts, and measured biochemical nutrient transformation functions. A meta-analysis will compare succession and function of other plant- and soil-associated microbial communities to explore the generality of rules for microbiomes across ecosystems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Local adaptation occurs when populations evolve to become more successful in their home environments. Harmful and beneficial interactions among species may create ""biotic"" patterns of local adaptation. Yet, variation in the strength of biotic adaptation across large landscapes remains poorly understood. Addressing this knowledge gap is urgent because climate change is expected to disrupt species interactions. Such shifts may challenge species' abilities to persist in changing communities. This work will generate crucial data about big sagebrush, a declining plant of restoration concern, and how its relationships with soil microbes may shift with climate change. The results of this research will be applicable to the selection of suitable seeds for restoration efforts. In addition, this project will create hands-on research and mentorship experiences for undergraduate students across disciplines. This work also aims to improve student retention in a large biology course, using active learning inspired by this imperiled native plant.<br/><br/>Local adaptation is foundational to understanding populations? current and future persistence; however, experiments examining local adaptation rarely isolate abiotic and biotic mechanisms. This research gap is urgent, as climate change may disrupt both abiotic and biotic fitness drivers simultaneously, potentially outpacing the adaptive capacities of long-lived species. The proposed work will integrate field- and lab-based reciprocal transplant experiments, sequencing of soil bacterial and fungal communities, and modeling approaches for species-rich communities to isolate the adaptive importance of plant-microbe interactions in big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) across environmental gradients. These results will be incorporated into population models to assess whether populations from contrasting abiotic environments differ in their susceptibility to disruption of biotic adaptation under changing climatic conditions. The project team will collect additional field data to measure the population models? predictive accuracy in quantifying the relevance of plant-microbe interactions to ongoing restoration efforts in big sagebrush.

Timely execution of these applications improves user productivity and reduces the energy consumption associated with each execution. Sparse computations are characterized as having inputs where many or most values are zero.  To avoid the inefficiency of storing and computing on zero-valued data, applications only store the nonzeros, with auxiliary data structures to recover their locations.  As a result, sparse tensor computations exhibit unpredictable memory-access patterns that include indirection through the auxiliary data structures.  Consequently, on today?s computer architectures, performance of sparse tensor computations is completely dominated by the movement of data, through the memory system and across nodes. Data movement is expensive both in terms of execution time and energy expenditure. Optimizing data movement of sparse tensor computations as high-performance architectures have become increasingly diverse ? conventional parallel architectures, graphics processors used as parallel accelerators and complex memory systems ? creates a performance and productivity challenge for software developers who end up writing low-level architecture-specific code for each platform. The proposed approach simultaneously optimizes how data is organized in memory, how the computation is structured to access the data in a way that reduces data movement, and how the computation and data movement make best use of features of the hardware architectures. Since the nonzero structure of the data is unknown until program execution, the approach also examines runtime information in its decisions.  The resulting co-optimization strategy enables a cohesive approach for iteratively making scheduling and data representation transformation decisions for a wide range of sparse computations and incorporating runtime adaptations.<br/><br/>This project is developing a programming framework that permits high-level specification of a sparse computation and optimizes it to reduce data movement.  It composes data representations, data layouts and storage mappings, and parallel schedules for sparse computations.  It employs data dependencies, runtime information, and architecture features to fully bind the final generated code. This approach is intended to enable handling sparse tensor computations with dependences such as sparse triangular solve and many other solvers for systems of linear equations, applying reorderings such as Morton ordering on sparse tensors, and late binding of sparse tensor data representations.  The novel and most significant aspects of the research include: (1) composable schedule and data transformations, including data layout transformations and storage mapping; (2) inspector synthesis for runtime data transformations between data representations, layouts, and storage mappings, which are composed with external functions; (3) support for data-dependent tensor computations; and, (4) framework abstractions deployed in the MLIR/LLVM compiler.<br/><br/>The researchers are strongly committed to broadening participation in computing and have comprehensive plans to engage the underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It will do so by developing an assessment to evaluate physics teacher preparation programs. This assessment will measure a teacher?s ability to accurately interpret and productively respond to students? ideas in physics.  The proposed assessment tool is intended to address a critical need for common measures of physics educator preparation programs. Such an assessment tool could guide the improvement of individual physics teacher education programs.  It would also enable reliable comparisons across programs, pointing the field towards the most promising approaches. In addition, the research required to develop the assessment tool is expected to further refine the construct of teacher attentiveness in physics, exploring the development and interaction of core content knowledge and core pedagogical content knowledge among preservice teachers. <br/><br/>The project has both a focus at the physics teacher preparation program level, and an end-goal of preparing teachers who can effectively analyze and respond to student thinking in practice.  Therefore, the project intends to develop a selected-response assessment, with a focus on authenticity in the operationalization of attentiveness.  Attentiveness, also referred to as responsiveness, is a complex process characterized by the ability of the teacher to identify the substance of students? ideas, to recognize the disciplinary connections in students? ideas, and to take up and pursue the substance of student thinking in light of disciplinary goals.  The project?s multi-phased development of assessment items for attentiveness in physics is modeled after the Mathematical Attentiveness in Pedagogical Practice item-development process, which gathers authentic responses from both students and educators in the development of a selected-response assessment. The distinct phases of item development will engage physics educators in the cognitive processes needed for attentiveness.  The three dimensions of this model include the following: (1) Identifying the pedagogical intent and key disciplinary concept(s) of a specific student task.  (2) making evidence-based inferences about a student?s understanding of the disciplinary concept being targeted; and (3) deciding on an appropriate pedagogical response that builds both on an individual student?s thinking and toward the disciplinary intent of the task.  The project intends to develop at least three tasks (3 items) for each physics topic (motion, forces, energy, and waves) for students. There will be at least two tasks (4-5 selected-response items for each task) for each topic for teachers. The authentic student and educator responses used during this development process could assist physics education programs to efficiently measure physics teachers? attentiveness. This work could support the identification of successful physics educator preparation programs.  It is expected to allow for better understanding of key elements of physics teacher preparation, as well as allow for continued theoretical work on the construct of attentiveness in physics education.

Many studies report that active learning strategies, also known as student-centered teaching, support student success in science courses, but there is no quantitative measure of how much student learning changes with different degrees of student-centered teaching. This IUSE Track 1 Engaged Student Learning Level 2 project will fill this need for quantification. Better understanding of these relationships will in turn allow science instructors to make data-enabled modifications to their teaching practices to best support student learning.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to correlate student learning and interest with different degrees of reformed teaching practices. The project will design a series of introductory geoscience lessons that can be classified as teacher-centered/didactic, transitional/ interactive lecture, and student-centered based on the Reformed Teaching Observation Protocol (RTOP) and Classroom Observation Protocol for Undergraduate STEM (COPUS) classroom observation protocols.  RTOP and COPUS are tools used to measure faculty teaching methods and student engagement in STEM classrooms.  The treatment lessons will be interspersed in classrooms at four different institutions over the course of multiple semesters so that students at each institution experience each lesson at each level of reformed teaching at least one time.  A series of conceptual assessments and student interest questions will measure student learning, students? perception of their learning, and student interest. Observations using the RTOP and COPUS protocols will measure the degree of student-centered teaching practices in both treatment and non-treatment classes. Demographic data will be used to assess if different degrees of student-centered instruction have any differential impacts on the learning, perceptions of learning, or interest for students with different demographic characteristics. The project will use a model selection approach to determine which factors (degree of student-centered teaching, student interest, student perceptions of learning, demographic factors) best predict student learning gains. The outcomes of this project will be a model that characterizes how student learning scales with different degrees of student-centered teaching. By integrating student demographics with learning and affect, this work will generate new information to characterize learning and affect for students from traditionally minoritized groups and will provide a framework that faculty can use to determine instructional practices they wish to adopt based on a clear target for improved student success.

Some of this frozen reservoir melts at the surface and directly enters the ocean. Some of the ice instead breaks off, making icebergs that melt as they float around the ocean like ice cubes in a glass of water. Where and when this freshwater enters the ocean can influence the ocean currents that carry heat, salt, and vital nutrients for marine life. However, we cannot tell if recent changes to the amount of Greenland ice that is melted and mixed into the ocean are important because we don?t yet have accurate maps of where exactly this freshwater enters the ocean. In this project, we will combine 1) photos of Greenland?s coastline taken from satellites and 2) measurements of the warm, salty, and fast coastal waters taken from ships and instruments in the ocean. From these observations we will create new maps of how much Greenland icebergs melted from 2010 to 2023. Our science team will develop outreach activities that focus on iceberg melting and will work with an artist to educate the public about the importance of iceberg melt and inspire them to think more about the Earth?s fascinating icy features. <br/><br/>Increasing freshwater flux from the Greenland Ice Sheet influences ocean properties, with potentially large consequences for circulation, marine ecosystems, and climate at local-to-global scales. The severity of the downstream effects depends on: the fingerprint of meltwater runoff from the ice-sheet surface, meltwater produced where the ice sheet flows into the relatively warm and salty ocean, and meltwater injected into the ocean by the gradual decay of icebergs. Variations in freshwater produced by iceberg melt are poorly mapped and yet may be incredibly important since icebergs can transport cold, fresh meltwater far from the ice-sheet margins to remote ocean basins. In this project, we will combine independent iceberg melt rate estimation methods using satellite and ocean observations. We will investigate the drivers of iceberg melt and also quantify potential errors and the uncertainty in each of our methods. We will pair the iceberg melt rate estimates with observations of iceberg production from the Greenland Ice Sheet to construct time series of iceberg freshwater flux from 2010 to 2023. The project will yield time series of iceberg meltwater flux maps and determine how iceberg meltwater compares to other freshwater sources, such as surface and subglacial meltwater runoff from the ice sheet. We will also produce several novel datasets (e.g., spatially distributed iceberg size distributions, melt rates, and freshwater flux time series) that will be valuable for studies focused on ice sheet-ocean interactions. We will incorporate data products produced by the project into the open-source QGreenland geographic information system package as part of efforts to increase data accessibility and use. The project also provides an opportunity for two female early career scientists to strengthen their research programs, and we will emphasize recruitment of underrepresented groups for junior personnel. Finally, the project team will develop K?12 outreach activities that demonstrate iceberg melting in a fish-tank fjord and will work with an artist who has experience in creatively disseminating polar research to a broad range of audiences; this will enable us to communicate our project findings more effectively to the public.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

ML in materials informatics is rapidly transforming materials science and engineering (MS&E) by an unprecedented ability to extend materials databases, improve materials simulation, mine texts, automate materials research and development, and accelerate materials design. As pointed out by multiple recent studies, including from the National Academies and the Minerals, Metals & Materials Society (TMS), it is essential to train a next generation workforce in ML for materials informatics to realize its enormous potential for improving the human condition through advanced materials. Unfortunately, ML in materials informatics is almost completely absent from today's materials curricula at the undergraduate level. However, the power of informatics tools combined with their rapid evolution and relative novelty in MS&E creates an opportunity for engaging undergraduates (UGs) with active learning through impactful research. With this motivation, the project will create new infrastructure and an ecosystem for the engagement and training of UGs across the U.S. in research using applied ML in materials informatics, called the Informatics Skunkworks. The Skunkworks consists of mentor/UG teams performing research in materials informatics. The project provides the teams with new resources, consisting of curricula, software, and research problems, and with a community of practice to support research and to work effectively and collaboratively. The low cost and accessibility of ML and materials informatics creates an opportunity for Skunkworks to engage mentors and students with limited research resources, particularly at institutions serving underrepresented groups. The Skunkworks is a sustainable and scalable approach that can fulfill this unmet need by training a diverse workforce skilled in research and application of ML for materials informatics. <br/>   <br/>The project will provide freely available (a) curriculum to train UGs in relevant ML, materials informatics and research professional development, (b) software tools that augment existing ML packages to be UG accessible, and (c) authentic and appropriate-level research problems. The proposed work will also develop a community of practice to enable a network of productive mentor/UG research teams to effectively and collaboratively use the curricular, software and other resources developed by the project to support transforming the future workforce. The intellectual merit of the proposed work is to (a) develop scalable resources to increase UG experience and learning in research at the boundary of data science and materials science and engineering, (b) grow a community of mentors and UG researchers engaged in materials informatics research, and (c) increase the utilization of data science tools for solving critical problems in MS&E and related fields through workforce development and materials informatics training. The broader impact of the proposed work is to (a) freely disseminate enabling curricula and tools for materials informatics, (b) train staff, mentors and UGs in broadly applicable research and professional skills, and (c) develop a diverse community of practice for materials informatics researchers. The project will enable the development of a new workforce capable of advanced materials informatics, especially for underrepresented groups, by supporting primarily UG institutions and community colleges that often have limited research resources.

Most mature ocean island systems comprise a nearly linear chain of volcanoes that increase with age in one direction, due to the tectonic plate migrating over the stationary magmatic source. However, the modern Galapagos volcanoes are situated on top of a large, shallow volcanic platform, which is atypical for an ocean island system. The presence of this massive platform has allowed the volcanic islands to remain subaerial for longer time periods, which has influenced biological speciation in the Galapagos. Despite this cursory understanding, very little is known about the construction, evolution, or composition of the Galapagos Platform. Thus, the outstanding goal of this research is to determine the compositions of lavas that make up the Galapagos Platform and relate them to spatial heterogeneity in the mantle source and the overlying islands. The project is in collaboration with UK scientists and will take place on a U.K. research vessel and use their remotely operated vehicle ISIS to sample the Galapagos Platform. This work represents an opportunity to collaborate with UK scientists on multidisciplinary oceanographic studies in the Galapagos. In addition, the ecosystems of the deep submarine environment around the Galapagos Islands remain virtually unexplored, despite the importance of the archipelago in evolutionary and biogeography studies, and the establishment of the Galapagos Marine Reserve, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The PIs will collaborate with the Galapagos National Park, the Ecuadorian Navy's Oceanography Institute, and Charles Darwin Research Station), which is the principal organization supporting scientific research in the area. Graduate and undergraduate students will be trained during the project.<br/><br/>Unlike many ocean island systems, the modern Galapagos Islands are situated on top of a large volcanic Platform that has been understudied compared to the subaerial portions of the islands. The goal of this work is to determine the chemical compositions of lavas forming the Galapagos Platform and relate those findings to the spatial heterogeneity in the mantle plume and the overlying islands with an overarching goal of understanding how the Galapagos Platform has formed in comparison to other ocean island systems (e.g., Hawaii). The ~21 days on-station field program using the ROV ISIS and the research vessel James Cook will be dedicated to sampling deep-sea corals (from a UK NERC funded portion of the proposal) and associated lavas from a broad spectrum of terrains along the margins of the platform, many never before sampled. The US-NSF component of this research involves ROV-based sampling and geological mapping of the volcanic stratigraphy at various locations along the margin of the Platform along with a comprehensive shore-based geochemical study of sampled lavas. These studies will allow an investigation of the volcanic emplacement processes involved in construction of the Platform and geochemical relationships between the submarine platform lavas and adjacent/overlying volcanic islands. During the planned research cruise, the most comprehensive and systematic in situ sampling of the volumetrically largest volcanic portion of the Galapagos Archipelago, the Galapagos Platform will be conducted. Results will test several important questions about the Galapagos Platform: i) is the Galapagos Platform spatially and vertically geochemically homogenous? ii) what is the relationship between the platform lavas, the overlying volcanic islands, and the overall evolution of the Galapagos Archiplelago? The field program is designed to map and sample several stratigraphic sections around the platform and will include detailed on-bottom observations, multibeam mapping, and in situ rock sampling. This will be followed by shore-based geochemical and textural analysis of lavas; including measuring major and trace element contents and radiogenic isotope ratios of the lavas. The results will be used to construct stratigraphic profiles of the Platform and compare submarine lava compositions to adjacent, overlying islands and deep-water lava flows to produce a comprehensive model for the formation of the Galapagos Platform.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Widespread improvement in the learning and academic success of students requires widespread commitment to good teaching by faculty and by educational institutions. Good teaching includes the use of student-centered, evidence-based, active-learning instructional practices. Although it is well-established that instruction using these practices enhances student success, faculty and institutions have been slow and inconsistent in adopting them. Shared measurements and evaluation approaches can enhance commitments to good teaching, but more work is needed to sustain improvements and to make good teaching the norm. To address this issue, the investigators have developed a framework and accompanying rubric to assess teaching effectiveness that emphasizes student-centered, evidence-based, active-learning practices. This project will investigate the potential of the framework and rubric in faculty evaluation processes.  To do so, it will set up a mock STEM ""department"" of 30 diverse faculty members, along with a mock department chair and a mock promotion and tenure committee. The mock department will use the framework and rubric in the course of faculty evaluation.  Using institutional data as the control, the project team will investigate how using the framework affects faculty members' teaching practices and attitudes about the campus climate around teaching. This small-scale study is one step toward achieving the vision of an educational system in which learner-centered teaching is appropriately assessed, recognized, and rewarded.<br/><br/>The goal of the project is to introduce a new strategy for assessing teaching and to explore challenges to its adoption, with the intent of informing policy, practice, and further development of the framework. The investigators' Framework for Assessing Teaching Effectiveness focuses on four elements of effective teaching, all of which need to be present to optimize student learning: effective course design, scholarly teaching, learner-centeredness, and professional development. Workshops will be offered through the Center for Teaching and Learning to support departmental implementation of the framework in faculty evaluation processes, support faculty members in compiling a teaching portfolio in response to the framework, and support instructors in adopting the kinds of teaching practices described in the framework. The investigators will examine whether changes to the framing and assessment of teaching will result in (1) changes in faculty members' perceptions of the campus culture and the value placed on teaching, (2) changes to teaching practices, and (3) increased motivation to adopt the effective teaching practices described in the framework. The investigators will measure potential changes in practices and climate using data from different sources, including faculty portfolio narratives and rubric scores, focus groups, and student outcomes, as well as tools such as the Evidence Based Instructional Practices Adoption Scale, the Classroom Observations Protocol for Undergraduate STEM, the Current Instructional Climate Survey, the Postsecondary Instructional Practices Survey, and the Student Evaluation of Teaching.

Oceanic transform faults are ideal for studying fault slip due to their simple composition and predictable motion - yet the spectrum of behavior on these faults is poorly understood. This study will employ a range of techniques to study the Chain transform fault in the equatorial Atlantic, which is an ideal locality due to its variable seismicity and its bathymetric expression that is typical of many transform faults. This project will train early career scientists in interdisciplinary marine science through their participation in research cruises and their analyses of data and samples. A broader cross-section of students will be engaged through a multi-institution virtual course on marine geology and geophysics. <br/><br/>Oceanic transform faults consist of sections that slip in large earthquakes separated by sections that are primarily aseismic. Oceanic transform faults also display a variety of structural features ? valleys, transverse ridges, median ridges, flower structures, fault segmentation ? whose origins are linked to stress, strain, and material properties. A two-cruise experiment will be used to probe these fault dynamics. The first cruise aboard the R/V Langseth will collect multi-channel seismic data and deploy 20 ocean bottom seismometers. A year later, a second cruise will recover seismometers, deploy the autonomous underwater vehicle Sentry for high-resolution geophysical surveys, and use dredging to sample the active fault zone. These datasets will connect surface observations of fault structure and composition to seismic constraints at depth. Goals include:<br/>? Substantially advancing current understanding of slow-slipping transform faults.<br/>? Surface-to-depth images of fault structures from seismic data and Sentry micro-bathymetry.<br/>? Identification of active fault strands and areas of active uplift based on linking microseismicity patterns and focal mechanisms to fault structures.<br/>? Deciphering how strain is accommodated on poorly coupled portions of the fault, and whether, and at which depth, those portions are characterized by swarms of microseismicity, as has been observed at faster slipping transform faults.<br/>? Determination of the dominant lithologies in the fault zone?including in uplifted structures?using samples, photo transects, and seismic velocity.<br/>? Elucidation of the role of fluids in modifying fault-slip behavior, based on sample analyses, chemical-sensor datasets, seismic-velocity variations, and microseismicity distribution.<br/>?

The amount of nitrous oxide emitted from rivers is difficult to estimate due to a lack of knowledge of the conditions that favor its production. Nitrous oxide is produced in abundant but small zones where oxygen is not available. However, the size of these ?microzones? makes them extremely difficult to locate and measure. This project will investigate the formation of low oxygen microzones in controlled conditions that mimic river sediments. Experiments and numerical simulations will be used to determine how bacteria growing in the sediments regulate the formation of these microzones. Knowledge of how bacteria control the size, location, and duration of low oxygen microzones will provide key information needed to estimate river nitrous oxide emissions with greater certainty. This research will not only reveal the processes responsible for nitrous oxide emissions from riverbeds and inform the design of strategies that can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but it will also improve understanding of how low oxygen microzones regulate contaminant transformation and nutrient cycling in groundwater. The research team will train future environmental engineers by mentoring trainees from diverse backgrounds at the postdoctoral, graduate, and undergraduate levels. Further, the team will lead activities to enhance public understanding of how shallow groundwater influences water quality in rivers, including a Groundwater Basics STEM summer program and field demonstrations for K-12 students and the public at a river restoration site.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to determine how nitrous oxide production is linked to the dynamics of anoxic microzone formation in river sediments. The project team will perform sediment column experiments to quantify nitrous oxide production at the macroscale, perform microfluidic experiments to characterize the spatial and temporal occurrence of anoxic microzones at the pore scale, and use process-based numerical simulations to link the two scales. Through these efforts, the researchers will test the novel hypothesis that coupling between fluid flow and microbial biofilm growth determines the spatio-temporal dynamics of anoxic microzones, as well as the delivery of reactants that fuel the production of nitrous oxide within microzones.

Effective educational interventions are needed that are intentionally designed to improve students? sense of belonging and engineering identity. This project will examine how engaging engineering students in personal and professional reflection activities at a time when they are encountering the most intellectually rigorous part of their engineering programs affects student persistence. A storytelling curriculum will be developed and implemented in existing engineering courses and will target undergraduate engineering students in their second and third years. Students will learn how to write personal narratives about their engineering education experiences and communicate them to audiences through live performances or video recordings.

The storytelling curriculum will be made available to the engineering education community through an online public repository.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop, implement, and examine the mechanisms and effects of a new storytelling intervention designed to help shape and reinforce engineering students? self-view. Past work suggests that storytelling pedagogy can support identity development. However, individual reflection and storytelling are typically not included in a traditional engineering curriculum that is focused on the application of scientific knowledge to solve engineering problems. This project will incorporate the element of storytelling and public performance into the pedagogy of multiple engineering courses. Undergraduate engineering students will learn storytelling techniques and apply these techniques to narratively communicate their personal experiences in engineering education. Using a mixed methods approach, this project will examine the efficacy of storytelling on student success in terms of students? sense of belonging, professional identity, and persistence in the major.

NNA projects address convergence scientific challenges in the rapidly changing Arctic. The Arctic research is needed to inform the economy, security and resilience of the Nation, the larger region and the globe. NNA empowers new research partnerships from local to international scales, diversifies the next generation of Arctic researchers, enhances efforts in formal and informal education, and integrates the co-production of knowledge where appropriate. This award fulfills part of that aim by addressing interactions among social systems, natural environment, and built environment in the following NNA areas: Arctic Residents, Data and Observation, Forecasting, Global Impact, and Resilient Infrastructure. <br/><br/>Seasonality shifts, thawing permafrost, and the occurrence of extreme weather conditions in the Arctic today have led to cascading effects in the natural and human worlds. Plants and animals are changing their seasonality and ranging patterns. These changes put increased pressure on livelihoods of peoples of the North, whose dependence on the natural world is tied to weather and seasonality. Globalization, such as the growing presence of industrial and urban centers, also impacts the Arctic tundra and livelihoods of Indigenous peoples as never before. By considering impacts of multiple climatic and socioeconomic drivers on the functioning of an increasingly industrialized Arctic region, this project crystalizes processes that are or represent potential threats to the well-being of Arctic communities relying on reindeer herding economy. This project co-produces knowledge with various stakeholders representing the Indigenous community, regional government, and industry sectors. The project links numerous disciplines and provides training opportunities for the next generation of scientists as well as broader exposure via an inter-institutional course-forum and public outreach events.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to understand how the natural, social, and built environment systems within a tundra region are linked in their responses to stressors. This project examines how (1) tall vegetation impacts animals and reindeer herders, and feedback mechanisms conditioned on human activities; (2) changing snowpack influences food webs and animal population dynamics, and alters decision-making by reindeer herders and other stakeholders; (3) the built environment affects the reindeer herding system, as well as interactions between industrial workers and indigenous people and perceptions of the environment by these groups; and (4) reindeer management, social institutions, and markets for reindeer products affect community resilience, indigenous traditions and practices, and landscape structure. The Yamal region of Russia is an ideal site as it spans four of the five Arctic bioclimatic subzones and has an unprecedented large-scale survey of Yamal in the late 1980s as well as voluminous Soviet-era anthropological research on reindeer herders.

The timing, causes, and impacts of this ?Cambrian Explosion? are poorly understood. Yet clues to understanding this event are buried in Cambrian strata that formed as oceans flooded the world?s continents, and coastal environments blanketed the landscape with vast swaths of sand, mud, and fossils. One of the best-preserved records of these events is in the bottom of the Grand Canyon?in a package of sedimentary rocks known as the Tonto Group. Although the Tonto Group has been studied for nearly 150 years, the availability of new techniques makes it time to revisit these classic exposures. This project will decipher how, when, and why these rocks were deposited, and lead to greater understanding of the Cambrian Explosion of life on Earth.  The broader impacts of this research include mentoring a suite of post-doctoral, graduate, and undergraduate scholars, including recruiting and training Hispanic and Native American students. Impacts also include outreach and distance learning through the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, to help this research inspire younger audiences, including 4th-12th graders in rural, first-generation, first-nation, inner-city, and culturally diverse settings. Finally, this project will reach many of the six million annual visitors to Grand Canyon National Park through Park programs, exhibits, media, and NSF-sponsored field forums on Grand Canyon geology.  <br/><br/>Cambrian rocks record dramatic changes in Earth systems including atmospheric oxygenation events, large magnitude perturbations to the carbon cycle, and the punctuated evolution of animal life. These events played out within the global transgressive inundation of continents by advancing oceans that deposited sheet sands, muds, and carbonates. Underpinning the research plan is a novel, integrative approach to calibrating the timing and tempo of this marine transgression. This approach combines: a) radioisotopic dating of the youngest, penecontemporaneously deposited zircon crystals, which are hidden amidst the detritus making up these sedimentary rocks; b) identifying changes in the types of fossils in the same rocks, and; c) documenting changes in mineral, chemical, and physical signatures of these rocks that record simultaneous, related changes in the Cambrian Earth system?such as changes in sea level or the collision and breakup of continents. Initial work has shown that the Tonto Group of the Grand Canyon is tens of millions of years younger than previously thought, that seas flooded North America relatively quickly, and that other continental margins experienced the same event. The project will expand upon a pilot study that was conducted in the Grand Canyon, and augment it with contemporaneous strata throughout the western U.S. to test hypotheses about how these flooding episodes relate to global biologic, tectonic, and geophysical events and processes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding the movement and availability of water locally and across the country is of paramount importance to economic productivity and human health of our nation. Hydrologic scientists, are actively tackling these challenges using increasingly complex computational methods. However, modeling advances have not been easily translated to the broader community of scientists and professionals due to technical barriers to entry. This software platform draws from computer models and employs supercomputers capable of analyzing big data to provide unprecedented simulations of water movement over the continental US. Combining hydrologists and computer scientists the team behind the project envision a broad community of users who will have multiple ways to interact with the software framework. For the hydrologic scientist who is interested in generating their own scenarios the framework will facilitate direct interaction with the hydrologic models and the ability to generate simulations on the fly. Conversely, the framework will also provide a set of static output and a range of tools for a broader set of users who would like to evaluate hydrologic projections locally or extract model data for use in other analyses.<br/><br/>Continental scale simulation of water flow through rivers, streams and groundwater is an identified grand challenge in hydrology. Decades of model development, combined with advances in solver technology and software engineering have enabled large-scale, high-resolution simulations of the hydrologic cycle over the US, yet substantial technical and communication challenges remain. With support from this award, an interdisciplinary team of computer scientists and hydrologists is developing a framework to leverage advances in computer science transforming simulation and data-driven discovery in the Hydrologic Sciences and beyond. This project is advancing the science behind these national scale hydrologic models, accelerating their capabilities and building novel interfaces for user interaction. The framework brings computational and domain science (hydrology) communities together to move more quickly from tools (models, big data, high-performance computing) to discoveries. It facilitates decadal, national scale simulations, which are an unprecedented resource for both the hydrologic community and the much broader community of people working in water dependent systems (e.g., biological system, energy and food production). These simulations will enable the community to address scientific questions about water availability and dynamics from the watershed to the national scale. Additionally, this framework is designed to facilitate multiple modes of interaction and engage a broad spectrum of users outside the hydrologic community. We will provide easy-to-access pre-processed datasets that can be visualized and plotted using built-in tools that will require no computer science or hydrology background. Recognizing that most hydrology training does not generally include High Performance Computing and data analytics or software engineering, this framework will provide a gateway for computationally enhanced hydrologic discovery.

This Agreement allows a single joint US/UK proposal to be submitted and peer-reviewed by the Agency whose investigator has the largest proportion of the budget. Upon successful joint determination of an award, each Agency funds the proportion of the budget and the investigators associated with its own proposals and component of the work.<br/><br/>This research project continues an 11-year field experiment called the Integrated Characterization of Energy, Clouds, Atmospheric state, and Precipitation at Summit (ICECAPS) and adds measurements along Lagrangian transects (ICECAPS-MELT). The project is an international collaboration that has been operating ground-based instruments at Summit Station in Greenland since 2010, taking observations of the atmosphere to advance understanding of cloud properties, radiation and surface energy, and precipitation processes over the Greenland Ice Sheet. It is an important time to make these observations because Greenland is undergoing changes due to rapid shifts in Arctic climate. The current project continues the observations made at Summit Station and expands measurements along transects to another important region of Greenland called the percolation zone. In this zone, melt water is generated at the surface, where it can percolate down into the snow and then refreeze. This creates ice layers that can cause additional melt water to move horizontally rather than vertically. It is important to understand these processes because melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet is a significant contributor to global sea level, which is predicted to impact humans significantly over the next century.<br/><br/>This new ICECAPS-MELT project complements the ICECAPS Summit observatory by building a new mobile observatory for measuring parameters of the surface mass and energy budgets of the Greenland Ice Sheet. This observatory uses a novel approach for unattended, autonomous operation by supporting instruments that require moderate power and internet bandwidth yet are quite like those operated at Summit Station. The new observatory measures surface mass and energy budget parameters, including precipitation, cloud properties, radiative and turbulent fluxes, near-surface meteorology, and subsurface temperatures and structure. To do this, the ICECAPS-MELT team deploys a precipitation radar, a cloud lidar, a microwave radiometer, a ground-penetrating radar, and an automated surface flux station, which consume approximately 500 W of power under normal conditions. The project will lead to new insights into how parameters of the surface mass and energy budgets co-vary in space and time between this new observatory and the ongoing measurements at Summit. Trajectory analyses track the changes in air parcels as they ascend the Greenland Ice Sheet and pass over the two observational sites. The mobile observatory will be deployed in successive summers at Summit Station in the dry-snow zone and at the DYE-2 station in the percolation zone. If this project is successful, a network of these observatories will be proposed for future deployment in southwestern Greenland, which will provide new insights into how atmospheric properties and processes are coupled both spatially and temporally to the ice sheet?s surface and subsurface conditions over Greenland.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As air temperatures warm, melting water from glaciers can be transported to the base of the glaciers where the ice meets the bedrock below. The addition of this water has caused dramatic acceleration of ice flow for some glaciers, small flow changes in others, and even deceleration for other glaciers. Changes in ice flow can be dramatic and unstable, leading to rapid glacier loss that cannot be predicted using current ice flow models. This project aims to better understand the links between glacier hydrology and ice flow by studying an event called a glacier surge during which the ice flow increases dramatically for a period of a few years. The project will conduct an integrated field, remote sensing, and modeling study of a glacier surge at Turner Glacier in Southeast Alaska. The scientific insights gained here will have broad applicability across glacier and ice sheet conditions in many parts of the Arctic and Antarctic, reducing uncertainties in predictions of global glacier loss in the coming decades. The project will strengthen the glacier research programs at Idaho?s two largest universities through interdisciplinary inclusive research, outreach, and community building. <br/><br/>The project will collect in-situ seismic, radar, geodetic, meteorological, and time-lapse imagery of hydrologic and glacier dynamics instabilities occurring throughout the upcoming surge of Turner Glacier. The team will combine in-situ observations with satellite-derived glacier velocity, elevation, terminus position, and subglacial plume data to map meltwater routing beneath the glacier during the initiation, propagation, and termination of the surge. These data will be paired with a state-of-the-art hydrologic numerical modeling to investigate the evolution of the controls on the hydrologic and dynamic glacier instabilities throughout the full surge. The unprecedented dataset, coupled with modern models, will yield improved, process-based understanding of a fundamental, 50-plus year-old, first-order question in glaciology: What controls the initiation, propagation, and termination of glacier surges? Given that the interplay between glacier hydrology, basal processes, and glacier flow remains one of the most fundamental questions in glaciology, the results of this project have broad societal impacts. Any insights into rapid instabilities in glacier flow triggered by climate will considerably advance our predictive capabilities of glacier change, and our ability to understand the impacts of ice mass loss on the Earth system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The first strategy, Explicit Attention to Concepts (EAC), is a set of practices that draw students' attention specifically to mathematical concepts in ways that extend beyond memorization, procedures, or application of skills.  This strategy may include teachers asking students to connect multiple mathematical representations, compare solution strategies, discuss mathematical reasoning underlying procedures, or to identify a main mathematical idea in a lesson and how it fits into the broader mathematical landscape. The second strategy, Student Opportunities to Struggle (SOS), entails providing students with time and space to make sense of graspable content, overcoming confusion points, stimulating personal sense-making, building perseverance, and promoting openness to challenge. This strategy may include teachers assigning problems with multiple solution strategies, asking students to look for patterns and make conjectures, encouraging and promoting discourse around confusing or challenging ideas, and asking students for extended mathematical responses. This project investigates whether the order in which teachers apply these practices within the teaching of mathematics content has an impact on student learning. This study builds on previous work that had identified an interaction between the EAC and SOS instructional strategies, and associated teacher reporting of stronger use of the practices with higher student mathematics achievement.<br/><br/>The project will have four key design features.  First, the project will adopt and extend the research-based EAC/SOS conceptual framework, and explicitly responds to the call for further research on the interactions.  Second, the project will focus on the mathematical areas of modeling and problem solving, two complex and critical competencies for all students in the middle grades. Third, the project will position teachers as collaborators in the research with needed expertise.  Finally, the project will make use of research methods from crossover clinical trials to implementation in classrooms.  The project aims to identify the affordances and constraints of the EAC/SOS framework in the design and development of instructional practices, to identify student- and teacher-level factors associated with changes in modeling and problem solving outcomes, to analyze teachers' implementations EAC and SOS in teaching modeling and problem solving and to associate those implementation factors with student achievement changes, and to determine whether the ordering of these two strategies correlates with differences in achievement.  The project will collect classroom observation data and make use of existing tools to obtain reliable and valid ratings of the EAC and SOS strategies in action. The design of the study features a randomized 2 x 2 cluster crossover trial with a sample of teachers for 80% power.  The project builds on existing state infrastructure and relationships with a wide array of school districts in the context of professional development, and aims to create a formal Teacher-Researcher Alliance for Investigating Learning as a part of the project work.<br/><br/>The Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools.

Current search engines, even ones specifically designed for children, offer weak support for children's search needs due to their developing skills related to spelling, language use (including synonyms), understanding categories, refining queries, and evaluating relevance and quality of results. This makes it hard for children to create effective queries, use the results suggested by the search engine, and understand the relationship between the queries and the results returned. Bringing together expertise in human-computer interaction, information retrieval, natural language processing, and education, the project team will both (a) further scientific understanding of children's search abilities, and (b) design tools to support it through the iterative development of CAST (Child Adaptive Search Tool), designed for children aged 6-11.  CAST will be designed to model and respond to users' literacy and maturity levels as well as search intent missing from their formal queries. For example, when a child submits the query ""Tiger"", CAST will tend to prioritize tiger habitat or Winnie the Pooh's friend Tigger, which likely correlate better to a child's search intent than information on Tiger Woods. To reach this goal, the team will collaborate with children and teachers throughout the course of the project, working with partners in several local schools to increase the impact of the application itself and to improve the dissemination of the results. The results on supporting search in the special population of children in this research also have the potential to inform similar problems and methods aimed at other populations who might have systematic differences in their search ability, from older adults to second language speakers.<br/><br/>The team will use two main lenses to guide the project work. The first is an educational research lens that grounds design activities in the known needs of children, for example, using spelling development research to create models of spelling correction that are tailored to this audience rather than general dictionary-based spelling correction algorithms. The second is a version of participatory design called cooperative inquiry that closely involves both children and teachers along with the research team throughout the design process, allowing the team to benefit from children's direct perceptions of their own needs and ideas for addressing them as well as the teachers' knowledge of children's needs when learning to search for information to support their own education. The work will proceed in three main phases.  The first phase focuses on defining requirements and resources, through partnering with local public schools and collecting publicly available datasets of children's search behavior, vocabulary lists, popular websites for kids, and other resources that can inform models and algorithms tuned to children's search.  The second phase involves designing and developing an initial version of CAST that includes methods to support query formulation, spelling, and navigating ontologies in order to help children better express their search needs, along with tools such as enhanced result snippets for evaluating the quality and relevance of results. The third phase will focus on evaluating both individual components and overall system quality; this includes using quantitative analysis of observable behaviors in the system such as queries, session lengths, and returned result quality as well as direct testing with children and teachers to evaluate their perceptions of the system's usability and their willingness to use it going forward.  The team will use the evaluations to iteratively measure both individual components and the overall system, which will be deployed at a number of public libraries in the project team's home state for use by children outside of the research context.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These processes in turn influence climate by altering important factors such as greenhouse gas concentrations like H2O and CO2. Human activities can change these pathways, and this research will enable the forecasting of the possible impacts upon the Earth-surface environment.

Prey, in turn, are under pressure to deflect predators away from vital body parts. To do so, some animals have evolved traits to take advantage of their assailants' sensory systems and vulnerabilities therein, creating sensory illusions - that is, discrepancies between what the predator perceives and reality. Understanding how prey manipulate sensory processing by their predators will reveal important driving principles and limitations of sensory systems. This team of researchers has shown that moth tails divert echolocating bat attack to these expendable appendages by creating an acoustic illusion. Using arrays of high-speed cameras and ultrasonic microphones, this research will quantify battles between bats and long-tailed moths and reveal the underlying mechanism of this illusion. To provide naturally replicated tests of their hypotheses, the team will study multiple origins of long tails in moths on different continents and incorporate this knowledge into a comprehensive phylogeny. In doing so, they will parse the roles of both constraint and selection on the emergence of convergent traits to reveal general principles that govern diversification. The team will engage in activities to broaden the impact of their work. For example, they will live videoconference from the field into undergraduate classrooms to use the natural charisma of bat-moth interactions to excite students and increase STEM retention. In addition, the team will produce a museum exhibit that will include hundreds of moth specimens, a rendition of the resulting phylogeny and multiple computer monitors displaying high-speed videos of bat-moth interactions. <br/><br/>Tactics adapted to circumvent the sensing strategies of predators are likely underappreciated defenses in diverse taxa. This project will determine the mechanism underlying deflection of bat attack by moth tails. The team will use 3D high-speed videography of bat-moth interactions to parse mechanistic hypotheses by quantifying precisely where bats strike their prey. In addition, they will quantify the physical information available to bats in returning echoes from moths using a 3D ensonification array and then pit those moths against bats in predator-prey battles to examine auditory object formation by the predator. The fundamentals of how bats organize and separate the auditory scene bear strongly on bat and insect ecology and evolution. By quantifying behavior across silk moth diversity, the team aims to test the evolutionary route of echoic profile convergence. They will quantify echoes reflected off hundreds of silk moth species across the world's tropics and build a robust phylogeny to unfold the pattern of convergent evolution and tease apart the roles of both historical bias and selection on the independent origins of this anti-bat defense. Understanding how moth tails alter echoic information to ""fool"" bats will reveal the limitations of an active sensing system that has been honed by millions of years of battling insect counter-defenses and may lead to an understanding of the fundamental limitations of extracting information from an echo stream. Further, this project has broad implications for the evolution of the diverse nocturnal insects, one of the dominant animal lineages on Earth.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Perennial Endemic North American (PENA) clade of Apiaceae is a group of ~200 species primarily from the western USA, representing one of the largest plant groups in North America. Diverse groups such as PENA complicate understanding where species boundaries are best drawn and limit implementing good conservation practices. The proposed work will utilize molecular, ecological, morphological, and climatic data to clarify the taxonomy and relationships of species within the clade and provide a revised and updated classification for this group. Web-based electronic publications that include interactive keys, as well as species pages with descriptions, images, distribution maps, and links to specimen data, will be developed.

It will provide a revised taxonomy for the entire PENA clade and disseminate this information online in the form of electronic monographs to support effective biodiversity management and stimulate further scientific inquiry. Although the primary goal of this project is to better delimit the taxonomy and species boundaries of the PENA clade, the completion of this work will allow future studies to investigate patterns and processes of speciation, ecological interactions, community assembly and provide a greater understanding for the diversification of western North American Flora as well as the Biota that rely on that flora.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is important to accurately describe the size, shape, and frequency of submarine lava flows to understand how mid-ocean ridge volcanic systems work. A recent National Academies report identifies description of eruptive sizes and frequencies as one of the outstanding grand challenges in volcano science. However, distinguishing and accurately dating individual submarine lava flows remains challenging due to inadequate dating techniques, as well as considerable technical challenges associated with making observations and collecting samples from the seafloor.  This project takes multiple approaches to measuring eruptive timing on the Southern East Pacific Rise (a mid-ocean ridge in the south Pacific). Data from self-driving underwater vehicles (AUV-autonomous underwater vehicle) will be combined with submersible observations and sample collection.  Sample chemistry and magnetic signals help determine age and eruption frequency of surface flows, while the AUV data provide high-resolution mapping of the sea floor and additional information related to sub-surface lava flow distributions.  The results will be combined into a model that can be and applied to other mid-ocean ridge settings. The proposed work will provide a comparison to the well-studied 9N section of the northern East Pacific Rise, expanding the small number of intensively-studied ridge segments.<br/><br/>The size, shape, and eruptive frequency of submarine lava flows are important first-order variables in our understanding of many mid-ocean ridge processes, including volcanic construction; magma recharge, flux, and storage; and the stability of hydrothermal systems and biological communities. A recent National Academies report identifies the quantification of eruptive sizes and frequencies as integral to one of the outstanding grand challenges in volcano science. However, distinguishing and accurately dating individual submarine flows in the geological record remains challenging due to inadequate radiometric techniques, as well as the considerable technical challenges associated with making observations and collecting samples from the seafloor. Further, for a process that is episodic, there is no commonly-accepted statistical framework for reporting or interpreting eruptive intervals. While considerable effort has gone into documenting eruptive history at 9N on EPR and at Axial seamount on the Juan de Fuca Ridge, constraining a spatially and temporally variable global system requires significantly more data, and perhaps new approaches. The proposed work takes an integrated approach to quantifying eruptive timing on the Southern East Pacific Rise by combining AUV (autonomous underwater vehicle) mapping with HOV (human occupied vehicle) observations and sample collection. Near-bottom sidescan and bathymetric data will guide sampling locations and provide important interpretive context, as well as the possibility of calculating flow volumes. Geochemical data will be combined with temporal constraints provided by geomagnetic paleointensity to define eruptive clusters. Near-bottom magnetic anomaly data will be used to link the surface paleomagnetic data with a depth-integrated signal and provide important constraints on 3D statistical models of flow distributions, which are also constrained by estimates of layer 2A thickness from existing seismic reflection data. Combined, these methods will enable identification of flow units, quantifying eruptive frequency, and assessing accretionary processes. The resulting statistical model can be tested against and applied to other mid-ocean ridge settings. Further, the proposed work will provide a point of contrast to the well-studied 9N segment and expand the small number of intensively-studied ridge segments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
