This project reinforces the mandate of the Native American Languages Act, passed by the U.S. Congress in 1990, which called for stakeholders, including Native American activists, to act together to ""declare to preserve, protect and promote the rights and freedom of Native Americans to use, practice and develop"" these languages. The TCUs in Montana have been offering Native American language courses to encourage the sustainability of Native languages. This collaborative project between the University of Montana (UM) and one of the TCUs, Chief Dull Knife College (CDKC), aims to support the efforts of Montana TCUs by enriching language instructors' and activists' experience through an exchange of ideas and knowledge with instructors and training partners from UM, CDKC and the American Indian Language Institute (AILDI) of the University of Arizona. The proposed activities foster a positive relationship across institutions and will help identify current issues that may become the focus of future training workshops. The project's broader impacts include building the capacity of language documentation programs at Montana TCUs, enhancing STEM education through technology utilized in language documentation and education, and serving underrepresented populations who often have difficulty accessing training due to the remoteness of their locations. <br/><br/>This collaborative project seeks to cultivate common ground for communication across institutional boundaries. It aims to promote the idea that an increased knowledge of linguistics, as a science, can benefit TCU programs related to indigenous language sustainability as well as the idea that linguistics can benefit from community input. The indigenous languages spoken in Montana are from four different families: Algonquian, Salishan, Siouan, and Kootenai, an isolate. Because of this, the proposed project will advance our knowledge of the linguistics of these languages. The project is also innovative in applying collaboration among linguists and community language researchers, a method known as Community Based Research (CBR) in a way that fosters and enhances our understanding of these languages' phonetics, phonology, morphosyntax and semantics through the lens of traditional environmental knowledge and ethnosciences. A collaborative team, consisting of four language activists from indigenous communities and four non-indigenous linguists, will travel to TCUs in Montana to learn about the current efforts and future goals of their language activities. The collaborative team will then host meetings with selected participants from the Montana TCUs for further discussions. Results will be compiled from these activities feed into future documentation research and indigenous language education through workshops that will circulate the information back to indigenous communities. These project outcomes have the potential to implement indigenous ways of knowing into language documentation projects."

This project will immerse first-generation, under-represented college students at the University of Montana Western in climate research. Students will investigate the region?s glacial history in collaboration with the NSF-supported Community Cosmogenic Facility at University of Vermont. The investigators will test the hypothesis that glaciers, located near large ice sheets and experience both cold temperatures and exceptionally low precipitation, may have reached local ice extent maximums considerably earlier than the Laurentide (i.e., Canadian) Ice Sheet maximum (~21,000 years ago). They will do this by sampling and dating glacier moraines in the Pioneer Mountains, which today have very low precipitation due to blocking by ranges along the Continental Divide. Glacier moraine sequences from the Pioneer Mountains may shed new understanding into the mechanisms by which mountain glaciers respond to Earth?s long-term orbital fluctuations and concomitant climatic changes. This place-based research project will provide the undergraduate students, many of whom are from rural Montana, with an immersive opportunity to better understand their own states? landscapes, the geomorphic processes that formed them, and the important climatic information they provide.<br/><br/>This research will provide insight into glacier advance and retreat during the last glaciation in continental climatic regions that were proximal to the Laurentide Ice Sheet (LIS), in an exceptionally dry mountain range where the glacial chronology has not been studied. The Pioneer Mountains are one of the few ranges in western Montana underlain by granite, making it feasible to use 10Be in quartz for cosmogenic nuclide exposure ages and thus produce the first moraine chronologies for the region. The investigators will test whether the differences in maximum-ice times found in eastern ID and northwestern WY are due to regional climatic contrasts, such as anticyclonic wind patterns driven by the presence of the LIS or non-climatic factors (e.g., hypsometry and response time). Such atmospheric pressure systems would deflect westerly maritime moisture flux away from the northern Rocky Mountains as the LIS developed, and therefore the glacier maxima in the Pioneers may precede the LIS maxima and the aforementioned glacier systems. Results from this work will advance the understanding of temperature-dependent glaciers under extremely dry and very cold conditions, providing insight about how current glaciers in the coldest, driest regions of the world may respond to modern climate warming.

In addition to their connections with physics, C*-algebras provide a useful framework for studying a variety of mathematical objects. Applications of C*-algebras beyond physics are also beginning to arise; for example, one can use C*-algebras to study both quantum information theory, and directed graphs, or networks. Conversely, the C*-algebras associated to directed graphs have proved to be key examples which have enhanced our understanding of the class of C*-algebras as a whole. This project focuses on a generalization of directed graphs -- higher-rank graphs -- and their associated C*-algebras. A better understanding of the C*-algebras associated to higher-rank graphs will strengthen our understanding of C*-algebras as a whole, and also their applicability to other areas of mathematics. In addition to involving graduate and undergraduate students in research about higher-rank graph C*-algebras, this project will also enhance the intellectual opportunities available to mathematicians at the University of Montana and at nearby universities, in two ways. First, it initiates an exchange program for research-level graduate students at the University of Montana, to enable them to spend a semester studying at a university which is offering an advanced graduate course or seminar that complements the student's research interests. Second, the principal investigator will host national and international research scholars at the University of Montana, and will facilitate these scholars' visits to other regional institutions during their stay in Montana.<br/><br/>Higher-rank graphs were introduced by Kumjian and Pask in 2000, in the hopes that their associated C*-algebras, like graph C*-algebras, would provide important insights about C*-algebras more generally. However, the structure of higher-rank graph C*-algebras is much more intricate than that of graph C*-algebras, and this complexity has limited the applicability of higher-rank graph C*-algebras to other areas of mathematics up to now. To reverse this trend, this project will (1) improve our ability to recognize higher-rank graph C*-algebras in other contexts; and (2) develop new, stronger tools for analyzing higher-rank graph C*-algebras. Towards the first goal, the principal investigator will clarify the relationship between higher-rank graph C*-algebras and their twisted counterparts, as well as investigate connections between higher-rank graph C*-algebras and other branches of mathematics (such as Lie algebras and lattices, and wavelets and multiresolution analyses). The second goal will be achieved by studying invariants of higher-rank graph C*-algebras such as their K-theory, groupoid structure, KMS states, and Cartan subalgebras.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Since its inception in 2008, the Institute on Collaborative Language Research (CoLang) has been a biennial venue for researchers and community language workers to receive intensive training in collaborative language research responding to the global need for quality language documentation in the face of the world-wide crisis in language endangerment. In 2020, CoLang will be held at the University of Montana (UM), co-hosted by UM and Chief Dull Knife College (CDKC -- a two-year tribal college of the Northern Cheyenne in Montana). It will bring stakeholders together to develop collaborative practices and extend networking among all participants including language workers, language activists, language teachers, undergraduate and graduate students, and linguists from both academic and language communities. In partnering with each other, CoLang 2020 co-hosts (UM and CDKC) will demonstrate an Indigenous/non-Indigenous collaboration at the organizational level and encourage participation from the Indigenous communities of the United States and Canada. The Institute has continuously advanced knowledge in linguistics by its role in developing and sharing cutting edge practices in the scientific, ethical and sustainable methods for understanding the linguistic structure of the world's estimated 7,000 languages and for understanding the complex and important role language plays at the community level. Broader impacts of project activities includes the training of a wide range of audiences in skills in community-centered language documentation, supporting and building capacity at Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs) in STEM through the language sciences and the broadening participation of American Indians and Alaska Natives in the language sciences.  <br/> <br/>With prior Institutes held in 2008 (University of California, Santa Barbara), 2010 (University of Oregon), 2012 (University of Kansas), 2014 (University of Texas-Arlington), 2016 (University of Alaska-Fairbanks), and 2018 (University of Florida), CoLang has developed a significant track record of national and international success, and previous participants have incorporated their Institute experiences into successful fieldwork projects and community documentation activities worldwide. CoLang 2020 will devote five weeks to intensive training in collaborative approaches to language documentation. The first two weeks will consist of focused workshops and organized discussions, providing hands-on training in the latest linguistic technology, interdisciplinary methods, and best practices in ethical community collaborations. The following three weeks are dedicated to ""practica"" (intensive field methods), where students will work directly with speakers of selected endangered languages to learn documentation methods and applications first-hand, integrating the skills acquired during the preceding workshops. The Institute is at the forefront of methodology development through the intensive training facilitated by co-instructors coming from the international community of indigenous and academic experts in linguistic and interdisciplinary researchers.

Recent research has revealed that the process of microbes taking up residence inside the cells of other species (known as endosymbiosis) is very common, especially among insects. For example, a single microbe called Wolbachia infects more than half of all insect species on Earth. Unlike mitochondria, Wolbachia are usually not required for their hosts to survive and reproduce. Instead, the proportion of individuals within a host species with Wolbachia at any time varies greatly for unknown reasons, making it hard to predict the consequences for host biology. This project will unravel the causes of variable Wolbachia prevalence as a model for more broadly understanding conditions that favor endosymbiosis. This work will also potentially contribute to improving human health. Wolbachia can block viruses like dengue and Zika in mosquito systems, but increasing the efficacy of this work requires identifying conditions that favor high Wolbachia prevalence. This project will identify such conditions in natural systems. Locally, this project will educate and train first-generation and Native Montana students in cutting-edge laboratory, field, and computational approaches that will improve their competitiveness in STEM-related careers. A new course at the University of Montana focused on host-microbe interactions will be further developed to include outreach activities aimed at exposing individuals in rural Montana to the unique biology of endosymbiosis.<br/> <br/>Organismal performance and fitness depends on interactions across levels of biological organization. Among all species interactions, those between animals and microbial endosymbionts that live inside their cells are perhaps the most intimate, influencing host behavior, physiology, life history, and fitness. Some endosymbionts may even contribute to reproductive isolation and speciation, highlighting their broad importance for host biology. The evolutionary outcomes of host-endosymbiont interactions ultimately depend on endosymbiont prevalence in host populations, which varies widely for unknown reasons. This project will leverage 50 million years of Wolbachia evolution distributed across divergent host species to determine the causes of Wolbachia frequency variation. The project will specifically dissect how genes in host and endosymbiont genomes interact with each other and with temperature (GxGxE interactions) to influence maternal Wolbachia transmission rates and the strength of Wolbachia-induced reproductive manipulations like cytoplasmic incompatibility. Mathematical models will then be used to evaluate how both genomic and environmental interactions contribute to Wolbachia prevalence in divergent host systems. At each step, this project includes activities that will leverage the unique biology of endosymbiosis to educate and train first-generation and Native students in Montana.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Generally, such stations service both scientists of the institution that runs the station as well as visiting researchers. This project will involve an expansion of laboratory facilities at the University of Montana's Flathead Lake Biological Station (FLBS), one of the USA's oldest field stations, to allow for increased capacity to house visiting researchers. This renovation is in response to major recent increases in activity at FLBS following hiring of a new director and new faculty at the station. Providing these new facilities is important because they will provide access to Flathead Lake, the USA's largest freshwater lake west of the Mississippi River, as well as lakes and rivers that flow in both relatively undisturbed environments as well as those being impacted by human activity, providing abundant opportunity for research on diverse topics. Terrestrial environments including grassland, forest, and alpine tundra can also be accessed. In addition to research advancement, the new facilities will advance education by providing greater access to diverse research projects for undergraduate students who enroll in summer field courses at FLBS.  Finally, this increased capacity will allow important new research to take place in this region on topics such as water quantity and quality, climate change, fisheries management, and assessment of invasive species and endangered species.<br/><br/>This project will involve a major renovation of the upper level of a building at the Flathead Lake Biological Station (FLBS; https://flbs.umt.edu/newflbs) to transform it from its current role as a storage facility for field equipment into a state-of-the-art research laboratory for visiting researchers, the FLBS Visiting Researcher Collaboratory (VRC). The targeted outcome is 820 ft2 of new research-grade laboratory space to support increased use of FLBS by external researchers drawn from the state of Montana and beyond. This renovation is in response to major recent increases in activity at FLBS following hiring of a new director and new faculty. These increases are bringing use of existing FLBS facilities to a saturation level, making it difficult to maintain and expand the role of the station in serving outside users conducting research in this region. The facility will allow new researchers to develop projects in the region?s diverse ecosystems and to continue or develop new collaborations with FLBS researchers to advance this work. By providing improved and expanded facilities for visiting researchers, the VRC will expand the ability of ecologists to make fundamental advances in our understanding of ecosystems in the Crown of the Continent and their response to ongoing global change.  The VRC will also increase the opportunities for rich interdisciplinary interactions among researchers and students at all levels.  FLBS also attracts students at all levels to Yellow Bay for summer classes, internships, and field trips. Developing a rich base of new ""outside"" users of the station will increase the opportunities afforded and perspectives gained by these students as well as the broader community with which FLBS interacts.

They are one of science?s most effective tools for studying such interactions on an atomic scale ? allowing us to peer inside atoms with unparalleled detail. For decades the United States has led the world in merged-beams science, but the recent decommissioning of our nation's premier instrument at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory has dropped the US behind Germany, France, and Japan in this critical area of research infrastructure. This program intends to restore the United States to global leadership by producing a next-generation merged-beams instrument capable of studying light-matter interactions across an exceptionally broad energy range, a capability no other instrument of its kind can match. This novel capability will be used to provide critical data to innumerable research fields ranging from clean energy production to stellar astrophysics to studies into the origins of life. This instrument will also be the most significant research tool of its kind in the Montana University System and will play a critical role in the education and training of generations of student scientists who otherwise lack access to advanced scientific research and instrumentation.<br/><br/>Most of the information we gather about our Universe is carried to us by photons that have interacted with ions. Our ability to decode this information is based on our understanding of these interactions, and this understanding depends largely on our ability to study photo-ion interactions in the laboratory. Of the few instruments capable of such measurements, merged-beams instruments at synchrotron facilities are particularly powerful for several well-known reasons, including precisely tunable energies with high energy resolution, high signal output, and the ability to determine absolute photoionization cross sections.  However, the size and complexity of traditional merged-beams instruments necessitate their permanent installation on a single, dedicated beamline which dramatically restricts the energies they can explore. With this award, the proposers will miniaturize the merged-beams apparatus into a novel ?roll-up? endstation that can be transported to and used at any synchrotron. This flexibility will allow it to be deployed on numerous synchrotron beamlines that collectively produce photons spanning the electromagnetic spectrum.

To accomplish this goal, the project includes interventions for both graduate students and the faculty mentors with whom they work closely, and it seeks to help transform the cultures of the departments to become more supportive and inclusive. This project addresses a gap in proven approaches to help graduate students manage the significant mental and emotional stresses and pressures they face. Counseling available on campuses mostly is designed for undergraduates, and little is known about how to empower STEM graduate students to cope with the stresses of their challenging research projects; overcome stigma, self doubt, and social isolation; and promote help-seeking and a sense of belonging. The situation is even tougher for women and minority students, veterans, students with disabilities, and students from disadvantaged backgrounds. Improving the well-being of diverse graduate students will boost their prospects for successful STEM careers ? thereby accelerating science and engineering progress and contributing to American economic growth and competitiveness. <br/><br/>The project goal is to design and pilot an innovative model for fostering graduate students? life-long skills for mental health awareness and well-being, while transforming the way faculty engage with graduate students. The first step will be to conduct baseline surveys of students and faculty to obtain information needed to prioritize and design educational interventions. Project components will include: 1) activities to reduce stigma; 2) facilitated psychoeducational peer mentoring to assist students in developing effective coping strategies and enhanced resilience; 3) STEM faculty workshops aimed at implementing holistic mentoring, enhancing inclusiveness, and transforming departmental climates; and 4) activities engaging advisors and advisees together in collaborative problem solving. After refining the approach and demonstrating effectiveness on the three campuses, the team will assist three other universities in adapting the approaches to demonstrate scale up. Overall, the project will establish an innovative, effective, and replicable model for improving STEM graduate education by elevating positive mental health to an important outcome. Evaluation feedback will help improve the activities and measure progress toward achievement of the goal.

Salish Kootenai College and Blackfeet Community College are both Tribal Colleges. Over its six-year duration, this project will fund scholarships to 105 unique full-time STEM students who are pursuing associate and/or bachelor degrees in Biological and Biomedical Sciences, Mathematics and Statistics, Physical Sciences, Engineering, Computer and Information Sciences, and/or Natural Resources and Conservation. First-year students in Bachelor degree programs will receive four-year scholarships while transfer students and first-year students in Associate degree programs will receive two-year scholarships. Students in the project will have access to a wide variety of supports such as individual mentoring from STEM faculty members and peers and monthly professional development opportunities with students from all four institutions. One of the unique features of the program is the collaboration between four institutions. This increased partnership between public research institutions and Tribal Colleges will facilitate a bidirectional sharing of best practices for mentoring, inclusive instruction, and student support. The partnership will also provide students with access to peers and faculty members at three other institutions within the state.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to increase STEM degree completion of low-income, high-achieving undergraduates with demonstrated financial need. The aims of this project are to increase the first-year retention and graduation rates for each student cohort, improve transition after graduation to either a STEM career or further higher education, and advance knowledge about issues and factors impacting advancement along the academic pathway. Montana faces post-secondary persistence challenges with two of its largest population groups: Native Americans and individuals from extremely rural areas. Each group faces unique persistence challenges, with some commonalities (e.g., strong ties to family/land, culture shock, stereotypes). Students with positive STEM-based identities perform better academically and are more likely to persist to earn a degree and stay in a STEM field. However, STEM-based identities can clash with personal identities, especially for students from marginalized communities. This project will add understanding in how to develop integrated identities that incorporate STEM identities and personal/cultural identities. To address the question of integrated identities, the social science research team will use a mixed-methods design. Findings will be synthesized into culturally-attuned, place-based knowledge that is useful for teaching, mentorship, and policy in STEM programs at Tribal and non-Tribal Colleges and Universities. This project will disseminate research findings, successes, and lessons learned to appropriate stakeholders via local and community meetings, presentations at regional and national events, and publications in relevant journals. These dissemination activities will take place on each campus and within communities as appropriate (e.g. Tribal Council meetings, community forums, and contribution to newsletters, websites, and other venues). This project is funded by NSF's Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields. It also aims to improve the education of future STEM workers, and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This transformation is a key step in several processes involved in the production of fuels, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, clinical reagents, and agrochemicals, however, the underlying chemistry of this important transformation is still being developed. In this project, Dr. Wang and his group plan to develop new complexes based on late first-row transition metals and a novel tridentate ligand platform discovered only recently. These metal complexes are expected to be strong oxidants to activate inert carbon-hydrogen bonds in hydrocarbon substrates and install desired functional groups on them. Based on preliminary results, it is expected that this project will establish key relationships between the structures, spectroscopic properties and oxidative reactivities of these complexes, and will shed light on further developing this system to a catalytic hydrocarbon functionalization method. Further, this project will provide a solid training ground to educate Montana high school and Native American tribal college students and teachers in the field of bioinorganic chemistry by establishing a ?Partnership in Bioinorganic Chemistry (PIBC)? program.

Although energy sector and agricultural sources are major contributors, natural microbiological sources account for roughly half of total global methane emissions.  Microbial methane production has long been assumed to be an anoxic process, carried out only under conditions of extremely low to zero oxygen. Recent research has demonstrated the potential for microbial methane production to occur in oxygenated upper waters of lakes and oceans through a previously unappreciated metabolic pathway present in microorganisms.  Under conditions of phosphorus deficiency, certain bacteria can utilize otherwise unreactive organic molecules known as methylphosphonates to meet their phosphorus requirements, releasing methane in the process.  The extent to which this mechanism supports the out-gassing of methane from lakes to the atmosphere is unknown, as are the consequences of changing environmental conditions upon it.  This project will address this knowledge gap by investigating the distributions, rates of and controls on aerobic methane production in Flathead Lake and 18 other Montana lakes of varying phosphorus deficiency status.  Because atmospheric deposition of pollutant nitrogen and deliberate measures to curtail phosphorus inputs to lakes can both lead to phosphorus deficiency, it is crucial that we know whether these factors may have the unexpected consequence of enhancing methane emissions.  This research will also directly support the education, field and laboratory experiences of graduate and undergraduate students and will provide training to local high school teachers from Native American (Kootenai and Salish) tribal lands.<br/><br/>This project will evaluate temporal and spatial variability in microbially-mediated, oxic methane production across lakes with varying phosphorus availability in western Montana. It is guided by the overarching hypothesis: diffusive effluxes of methane from oxic freshwater lakes are directly influenced by the nature and severity of ecosystem nutrient (nitrogen, phosphorus) deficiencies. A combination of observational and experimental approaches employing chemical, stable isotopic, metagenomic and PCR-based gene analyses will be used to examine: 1) time and space variability in the concentration, stable isotope composition, and net production of methane in freshwater lakes in Montana, focusing on Flathead Lake; 2) The extent to which microbial methylphosphonate degradation results in net production of methane in these lakes; 3) The functional diversity, abundances, and transcriptional activities of microorganisms involved in both phosphonate and methane cycling; and 4) How the stoichiometry (specifically nitrogen:phosphorus ratios) of aquatic nutrient (inorganic and total) pools influences oxic methane production and expression of methane cycling functional genes. The study will provide a systematic evaluation of microbial methane sources and the potential contribution of methylphosphonate degradation as a source of methane in oxic freshwater lakes. Results from this project will provide new insights and advance current understanding of coupled interactions between carbon and phosphorus cycling in freshwater lake habitats.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Specifically, questions from the areas of snow water resources, wildland fire management, and abandoned oil well monitoring will drive the research agenda. The scientific work is united by a common set of techniques for answering questions. Moreover, the common approach is to: 1) Use unmanned flying vehicles called drones to collect pictures and other measurements. While the information acquired by drones is high quality, it is also a large amount of complex data. 2) To aid in the data?s interpretation and address the science questions, we use machine learning methods that train computers to identify patterns in data. Collecting data using drones and the use of machine learning are critical skills for America?s future workforce. Our activities are aligned with career training through partnerships with local companies and internships for participating students. With the emphasis on internships, the focus will be retention, rather than recruitment of students.  Diversity and inclusion efforts will work in tandem with workforce development to ensure that Indigenous, low income, and rural members of our jurisdictions are integral to the efforts. <br/><br/>It is proposed to use machine learning (ML) to process imagery and other data acquired by autonomous aerial systems (UAS). Processed data will support scientific research in natural resource management by providing a clear means of testing hypotheses. The three areas of natural resource management to apply this approach are: 1) snow water resources,  because energy production, agricultural output, and economic growth require improved assessment of the natural capital banked in the mountain snowpack. 2) fire management and science, because an advanced understanding of the physical and ecological processes driving wildfire is required for management practices that better protect forests and the critical infrastructure within them.  3) abandoned oil well monitoring, because detecting and mapping uncapped or improperly sealed oil and gas wells will provide critical data for improved mitigation, site reclamation, and hazard removal. The team bring together the University of Montana and the University of Alaska Anchorage to conduct locally relevant research. The local focus strengthens the relations with nearby commercial interests to identify questions common to academic and commercial endeavors in modern natural resource based economies. Attention is called to UAS and ML as skills vital to both commercial and academic work. To advance the natural resource based advanced manufacturing industries of the jurisdictions, special consideration is given to developing a workforce that spans from two-year college graduates to junior faculty members. This award's plan centers on paid, credit-bearing internships with key partners, drawing commercial interests into the proposed work, and bringing junior faculty to the research. Diversity and inclusion efforts will work in tandem with workforce development to ensure that Indigenous, low income, and rural members of the jurisdictions are an integral part of efforts.

However, as non-point sources of pollution, septic-derived wastes receive poor regulatory oversight. Septic system maintenance and eventual replacement is entirely reliant on individual homeowners. In the state of Montana, nearly half of all homes utilize septic systems for wastewater disposal. The combination of expanding populations, with dispersed development, and hence increased dependence on septic systems, together with weak regulatory enforcement, has high potential to lead to increased septic-derived degradation of surface waters and groundwaters across the state. The harnessing of smart technologies, including real-time data collection, transmission, and automated data analysis, may provide a novel opportunity for engaging homeowners in septic system best practices.  This project will engage active stakeholder groups in the Flathead Basin, including the Flathead Basin Commission, a state-legislated organization; nonprofit water protection groups; and state and federal agencies. By forging new collaborations between natural and social scientists and the basin-wide community, the project will identify data-driven solutions to a growing problem specific to lake water quality.<br/><br/>This project will engage a local stakeholder network, building on their work to date to address septic systems as a non-point source of pollution to Flathead Lake in northwest Montana. Specific planned activities as part of the project include: (a) co-host a 3-day workshop of local and basin stakeholders to identify gaps in research, knowledge, and expertise; (b) proof-of-concept on the use of real-time data to motivate homeowners to adopt septic system best management practices; (c) pilot a shoreline monitoring approach using a combination of remote sensing and microbial source tracking technologies to identify lakeshore areas receiving poorly treated septic leachate; and (d) assess policies and governance frameworks, including incentives and financing solutions, that work to mitigate the risks from failing septic systems to public health and surface water and groundwater contamination. This project's interdisciplinary approach combines efforts to understand environmental responses, potential behavioral responses of homeowners, and possible policy and governance responses to the septic issue, which is a first step to resolving knowledge gaps that prevent identifying solutions. Outcomes from our activities will inform a subsequent effort to advance data and research infrastructure in geospatial and socio-hydrological sciences, with specific focus on strategies for developing a smart and connected basin community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This snow feeds streams and rivers as it melts.  Measuring the amount of water stored and drained in the mountains is very difficult, but it is important for predicting water available to humans and the environment.  Recently, scientists have observed that the weight of the water collected during winter pushes the surface of the earth down, and that the surface rebounds as the water drains out.  Highly accurate, Global Positioning Systems (GPS) measure these changes to the Earth's surface. This project measures the up and down movement of the earth to estimate the volume of water stored in the mountains.  GPS stations are installed in the mountains of Idaho and Montana to measure the up and down movement of the Earth. Snow depth and water content are also measured. These data determine the best methods for calculating the amount of water in the mountains. Approximately 100 undergraduate students are trained during immersive learning experiences in summer classes. <br/><br/>In regions of substantial topographic relief, the water loading and unloading is highly heterogeneous due to nonlinear feedbacks among weather, landscape morphology, and water exchange among terrestrial reservoirs.  This project tests techniques for removing long wavelength regional hydrologic load and downscales geodetic water loading to 10-100 km.  A network of Global Positioning Systems (GPS) and weather stations are installed across a watershed in northern Idaho and western Montana.  High-precision observations of the watershed hydrologic load using a combination of field and remotely sensed measurements is used to constrain the local hydrologic load independent of GPS measurements.  The project tests the spatial and temporal sensitivity of GPS observations, and investigates time constants for different loading and unloading mechanisms including: snowpack dynamics, surface runoff, shallow and deep groundwater flux, and evapotranspiration.  The quantitative methods produced here facilitate advances in the basic understanding of watershed function as well as produce new tools for monitoring hydrologic resources. Undergraduates are trained in field geophysics and data Integration courses.

Whether this exchange of genetic material has positive or negative effects on population persistence is a longstanding but still unresolved issue in evolutionary biology. This issue has conservation relevance in the context of habitat fragmentation. Habitat fragmentation is a major threat to natural populations of many species because it prevents genetic exchange and isolates populations. Small and isolated populations often suffer from a loss of genetic diversity, increased inbreeding, and a reduced ability to adapt to new environmental conditions. The goal of this project is to experimentally induce genetic exchange in isolated natural trout populations as a window into understanding the effects of gene flow. This work will help resolve longstanding questions in evolutionary biology and will help to inform conservation and management. There is substantial interest in using strategic translocations of animals or plants to help save isolated populations from extinction. However, concerns about the possible negative consequences of genetic exchange have limited the application of this management approach. The educational components of this research will teach management professionals and Montana students, at all educational levels, about the application of genetic principles to conservation. <br/><br/>This project will test the costs and benefits of experimental pulses of gene flow into isolated populations of trout in both the eastern and western United States. In the first study system, experimental gene flow from outbred immigrants into inbred recipient populations is predicted to have a positive fitness effect through the alleviation of inbreeding. In the second study system, experimental gene flow from inbred immigrants into inbred recipient populations is predicted to have negligible fitness effects because inbred immigrants will not mask deleterious alleles in inbred recipient populations. The work will examine the possible negative effects of gene flow at organismal and genome levels in both study systems. The project will also use innovative educational approaches to increase knowledge of genetic principles in current wildlife professionals, future professionals currently enrolled as undergraduates in the nation's leading Wildlife Biology program, and rural Montana middle school children."

This project studies changes over ten years in the Upper Clark Fork River in Montana following a large project that restored vegetation and removed contaminated soil after damage from extensive mining in the river?s headwaters. Changes in land use and wastewater treatment are also altering nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations along the river. Since 2013, nearly 17 km of river has been restored and three core data sets have been collected, which were initiated decades before the restoration. The long-term measurements and the spatial scale of the study provides an opportunity to observe the ecological processes involved in restoration practices. Several undergraduate and graduate students are educated as part of this project, data are made available to the public, and results are shared with many stakeholders in this river system through the Clark Fork Science Forum.<br/><br/><br/>The study system of the Upper Clark Fork River in Montana, has several unique qualities that enable this project to make significant scientific advances. First, the system has received high inputs of metals that have since ceased. This enables investigation of the ecosystem dynamics over time in response to this cessation. Second, the investigators have closely observed ecological and biogeochemical responses over decadal timescales, which is the appropriate timeframe to study the types of slow processes involved in river ecosystem recovery. The project generates core data sets including: 1) influences on organic matter and sediment metals, 2) changes in upstream-downstream gradients in sediment metals, 3) metabolic responses to floodplain reconnection in restored reaches during the spring flood pulse vs. summer baseflow, 4) changes in metal bioavailability caused by interaction with dissolved organic matter, and 5) measurements of nitrogen, phosphorus, and dissolved organic carbon in restored and unrestored parts of the river. Ultimately, this project investigates river ecosystem responses over large spatial (>200 km) and temporal (> decadal) scales.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Connecting polar-focused material with innovative teaching methods presents an opportunity to advance Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education and increase polar knowledge. The overarching goal of the ""Polar Space and Place"" project is to study the use of innovative and potentially transformative instructional technology to enhance and enliven STEM undergraduate teaching and learning. Within this goal, the Polar Space and Place curricular materials and education research will address three objectives: 1) to advance spatial learning in the geoscience curriculum, 2) to increase polar knowledge and interest in undergraduate STEM majors, and 3) to develop and test innovative teaching tools and methods to increase ?sense of place? (a primary place-based education goal) remotely.  The Polar Space and Place project will benefit society by testing, improving, and sharing tools to enhance STEM education. Furthermore, it will increase undergraduate spatial thinking skills, as well as students? knowledge of and connection to the polar environment. These in turn support gains in overall Earth science and climate literacy. Through partnerships with the National Association of Geoscience Teachers (NAGT) and the Science Education Resources Center (SERC), project activities and material will reach a broad audience. SERC website material is freely available, and curriculum will also be linked to other popular resources including InTeGrate, GETSI, Teach the Earth, and Cutting Edge. Many educators will also be exposed to the materials and research findings via NAGT-sponsored webinars, Earth Educator Rendezvous activities and small workshop activities at the conferences and meetings attended by the diverse project team. <br/><br/>Researchers will use the NSF InTeGrate and GETSI techniques to develop two new instructional modules to be deployed at a total of four institutions.

Working in the Magdalena River basin, Colombia, students will learn cutting-edge field, remote sensing, and computational tools, develop critical and systems thinking, and complete team-based research projects. Students will work with instructors from University of Montana, University of Colorado, and Colombia, taking advantage of long-term research sites in the Magdalena River basin and broad expertise. The Rivers of the Andes Field Training course will recruit a diverse group of students that broadens participation in sciences, and course materials and lessons learned will be shared openly and widely.<br/><br/>River systems are under stress from climate change and growing demands for water, energy, and food. There is a strong disconnect, however, between where research and teaching about fluvial processes is concentrated, and where stresses on river systems such as new dam construction and associated impacts on humans and biodiversity are more recently evolving, such as in the Andes. Moreover, innovative and interdisciplinary approaches are needed to address challenges such as those surrounding river systems and to prepare students for the 21st century workforce. To address these challenges, we propose Rivers of the Andes Field Training (RAFT), a course to be taught in Colombia that will provide field-based training in river sciences. Course content will focus on hydrology and fluvial geomorphology, especially river mechanics, floods, and sediment regimes, and complementary content in tropical fish ecology and basin-scale, cumulative-impact and decision-support analysis.  RAFT will use the Magdalena River and its tributaries as a field site to illustrate broader content about river processes and Andean rivers. The course will augment field training with classroom teaching about fluvial processes and observational, measurement and modeling approaches for understanding river processes. RAFT will provide a transformative experience for graduate student participants by combining innovative approaches and technologies with evidence-based best practices to not only advance knowledge of river sciences and associated tools, but also to promote critical and systems thinking and observational, interdisciplinary, and teamwork skills. RAFT will include international and multicultural experience, interdisciplinary teaching on cutting-edge process knowledge and tools, training in cross-scale and systems thinking, team-based projects, and practice in science communication.

The origins of inequality in ancient societies is a central concern in anthropological archaeology with significant implications for wider understanding of inequality in today's world.   Previous research has documented conditions under which persistent institutionalized inequalities are likely to develop.  These include the presence of defensible subsistence resources and the possibility for inter-generational transmission of wealth, access to wealth, and rights to wealth.  Debate continues regarding the historical processes that give rise to material inequality with some reseachers asserting inequality to be an inevitable outcome of inherent human striving for personal economic and reproductive success under conditions of resource abundance versus others who argue that inequality is an unintended byproduct of competitive conditions during periods of resource shortfall.  Archaeology is poised to offer significant contributions to these discussions given the ability to reconstruct social evolutionary process over lengthy time spans.  The research is designed to facilitate extensive public outreach regarding indigenous culture and history along with STEM training opportunities for college students.    <br/><br/>Dr. Prentiss and her research team will examine the origins of material wealth-based inequality at the Bridge River village in the Middle Fraser Canyon of interior British Columbia.  The Bridge River site is an ideal place to study the evolution of inequality given the excellent record of human occupation spanning the past 2000 years.  This archaeological excavation project is designed to develop fine-grained tests of alternative hypotheses concerning variation in the integrated roles of demographic change, subsistence intensification, storage variability, social networking, and large scale cooking and food-sharing (""feasting"") events associated with the origins of inequality.

The NALA can be reinforced by ethical and well-planned research conducted by researchers and stakeholders from Native American communities. However, such research is often led by outside researchers. With a community-based research (CBR) approach, this project will broaden participation in language research from underrepresented institutions ? specifically, tribal colleges and universities (TCUs) in the state of Montana: Aaniiih Nakoda College, Blackfeet Community College, Chief Dull Knife College, Fort Peck Community College, Salish Kootenai College, and Stone Child College. The activities consist of (i) a national conference for language researchers and language workers from communities and academia, (ii) on-site workshops for TCU scholars, and (iii) a convening among researchers, community stakeholders and TCU scholars about language science. The project will build capacity at the TCUs by providing training venues for TCU scholars to develop research skills in linguistics, language acquisition and related fields in ethno- and health sciences and will lead to the designing of research projects in language science. The trainings and discussions will improve participants? understanding of linguistic structures, support the development of more sophisticated language research at TCUs, and promote the CBR approach, and the incorporation of the research results will contribute to the communities? language revitalization efforts.<br/><br/>This project?s linguistic training includes methods for observing complex language data, organizing data based on form and function, finding patterns and essential problems, addressing issues, and solving problems.

The project exploits a recent observation that a hydrogen bond that is judicially placed in a chain molecule can cause the molecule to fold, mimicking the folding ability of proteins and nucleic acids.  Special functional units are strategically placed inside the molecular tube to allow for the transport of anions.  The project helps define the requirements to efficiently incorporate the hydrogen bonding into molecular design, producing a new tool for molecular recognition and self-assembly.

An increasingly well-recognized factor that interacts with climate change to amplify the melting of ice and snow is the proliferation of algae that bloom on the snow surface (snow algae). Current understanding of the factors that control the abundance of snow algae, and thus their impact on snow and ice melt, is incomplete, especially in alpine environments where glaciers and snowfields are critical components of the water supply and are particularly susceptible to climate change. This project will examine an important but understudied driver of snow algae abundance ? the variable input of key nutrient elements (nitrogen and phosphorus) via atmospheric deposition (in snow, rain, and dust). This project leverages and develops the capacities of an interdisciplinary team involving faculty, a postdoctorate, a graduate student, and undergraduates in a project of broad societal relevance given the crucial role of mountain snow in water supplies globally. Collectively, these studies will be among the first to explicitly test for nutrient limitation of alpine snow algae, significantly enhancing current understanding of how nutrient supplies drive large-scale ecosystem dynamics in the cryosphere. In particular, this information is critical for understanding and forecasting the role of snow algae in driving cryosphere loss, a process that ultimately has major impacts on sea level rise and freshwater supply. Project personnel will develop and deliver a unique ?Cryosphere Ecology? undergraduate field class that will integrate key topics and concepts in ecosystem ecology, microbiology, and snow science. Public outreach will include contacts with water resource stakeholders and managers as well as communication to broader audiences via existing public outreach channels.<br/><br/>This research will examine the impacts of nitrogen and phosphorus inputs on snow algae in six study regions in the western USA across a gradient of atmospheric nutrient deposition. The project has three focal questions: 1) How are snow algae biomass, productivity, and carbon:nitrogen:phosphorus ratios related to patterns of nutrient (nitrogen, phosphorus) deposition and availability in mountains of the western USA? 2) How do these snow algae ecosystems respond to experimental nutrient enrichment? 3) How does proliferation of nutrient-driven snow algae affect albedo properties of snow and thus accelerate snow melt? To answer these questions, this project will assess how snow algae proliferate in snow formed from meltwater from the six study regions (using the unique capacity of the Subzero Research Laboratory at Montana State University) and test how nitrogen and phosphorus enrichment affect snow algae growth and its impact on albedo and melting under both field and laboratory conditions. Answering these questions will produce novel fundamental knowledge of the role of nutrient limitation in snow algae ecosystems and the connection between nutrient inputs and biological albedo reduction, facilitating better forecasting of snowmelt-driven water supplies in mountain regions and providing a basis for mitigating processes that drive inputs and transport of atmospheric pollutants. The project will also support development of an interdisciplinary course in cryosphere ecology, encompassing snow science, biogeochemistry, microbiology, and phycology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Methods for mapping the atomic structure of molecules are diverse, yet recent advancements have inspired innovative techniques making more complex structural studies possible. This fellowship will enable training in a rapidly developing cryo-electron microscopy (CryoEM) method called microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED). MicroED maps molecules using the same diffraction phenomena as X-ray crystallography. However, MicroED employs electrons which permits data collection on crystals about a billionth of the size needed for X-ray diffraction. Using such vanishingly small crystals helps address a common obstacle of small molecule and macromolecular X-ray crystallography?achieving sizable single crystalline materials. This feature will motivate further refinement of MicroED methods, and the technique will ultimately become a common option for structure elucidation studies. The training will be reinforced by the curation of education materials that will benefit future generations of structural scientists and promote the value of this emerging technique.<br/> <br/>The primary objective of this proposal is for the PI to acquire the ability to lead and conduct MicroED experiments to elucidate molecular structures. Through remote learning and collaborative visits to the National Center for CryoEM Access and Training (NCCAT), the PI and two trainees will obtain comprehensive instruction on the entire process of MicroED analysis from fundamental theoretical aspects through to data presentation. The project will be research driven, focusing on both halogen bonding oligomers and the resistance to inhibitors of Cholinesterase 8A (RIC-8A) protein. The small molecule and macromolecular studies reflect the diversity of MicroED studies and will ensure that a diverse range of researchers may take advantage of the PI?s new MicroED skillset.

However, training opportunities for the specialized workforce are often limited; the field of computational biology presents a challenge to many universities because of their departmental structures and disciplinary silos. In the rapidly evolving scientific world, the practice of sharing data among science practitioners is opening up new research avenues such as containing a pandemic using multidisciplinary approaches or the development of precision medicine for the future of health care. At the same time, the wealth of biological data is accumulating faster than the research community?s ability to analyze them. One bottleneck for analysis is a shortage of computational biologists. In order to fill some of the training gaps for U.S. graduate students, we will offer two Advanced Studies Institutes (ASI) with international experts from various disciplines of computational biology. The two proposed ASIs will train the students, the majority of whom will be from EPSCoR states with a special effort to recruit minorities and women, on diverse fundamental/theoretical aspects of computational biology as well as expose them to recent applications and developments in the field. In addition, to give the participants an opportunity to learn about various career possibilities in computational biology, an experienced team of academic faculties, core service providers, scientists with experience in relevant industries and individuals working on intellectual properties and start-up companies will be invited as instructors in these ASIs. The impact of the ASIs on scientific preparedness of student participants aligns well with NSF?s mission to promote the progress of science. Training the participants on different aspects of computational biology during the ASIs will contribute to the easing of the bottleneck and aligns well to NSF?s mission to advance the national health.<br/><br/>One of the key factors to success as a computational biologist is versatility and the ability to align oneself with the diverse demands of the field. Typically, students are trained in only one or very few aspects of computational biology relevant to their immediate research. It is rare that graduate students are exposed, in any meaningful way, to the breadth of fields that compose computational biology. The two proposed ASIs are different from traditional ASIs, which typically cover one specific subject matter in depth. Instead, the proposed ASIs will cover multiple cross-disciplinary topics in computational biology. Learning is a complex phenomenon, and the most effective training approaches combine a balance between lectures, promotion of discussions, interactivity and practical applications. These ASIs will combine all aspects of the aforementioned learning tools by implementing instruction methods comprising of lectures, hands-on activities and projects. These workshops will be held in an international setting, which provides both exposure to culture and as well as leaders in computational biology outside of the USA. The locations in Asia are important as non-American/European science and economy continues to grow rapidly in importance, especially within computational biology. The proposed ASIs will be hosted at the University of Perdana in Malaysia and the National Supercomputing Center in Singapore (NSCC) - two dominant biotechnology hubs of Asia. The participants will have the opportunity to build professional relationships with international students, faculties and industry leaders from Asia, USA and Europe. During the workshop, participants will be encouraged to participate in cultural experiences that will expose them to the history and culture of the host country. A website will be built for the ASI and will be used for recruitment, coordination and evaluation. A summary of the activities and their effectiveness in training participants, as judged by the participants, will be reported in a peer reviewed journal. Students will be primarily selected from EPSCoR states, with emphasis on recruiting from minorities (especially Native American) and women, with the aim of increasing participation of under-represented groups in computational biology.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE), and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recent scientific reports highlight how vulnerable the Greenland Ice Sheet is to Arctic climate change and draw a dire picture of the impact of sea-level rise. In order to equip society with the best forecasts of sea level rise for planning, scientists need to improve the ability to simulate ? or model ? the response of ice sheets to climate change. For this project, scientists from different branches of ice-sheet research will work together to improve ice sheet modelling. The researchers will leverage recent scientific advances to model the entire Greenland Ice Sheet in order to investigate long-term ice-sheet sensitivity to changes taking places in the ocean and atmosphere. The research group is committed to creating an inclusive environment where all team members can learn and excel. The team contains diversity in ethnicity, gender and rank, and will train six early career scholars, recruiting specifically from groups underrepresented in the geosciences, which is among the least diverse STEM fields in the U.S. Results will be made publicly available and will facilitate a broad range of future research about the Arctic system, including ice sheet modeling, model spin-up, paleoclimate reconstruction/synthesis and glacier history. To elevate the capacity of outreach and education programs developed during their first project, the team will build on their ?Scientists are Superheroes? outreach program and leverage other, existing outreach frameworks, including making connections with Greenlandic communities and with high school student intern programs at their universities linked to The Young Women?s Leadership School (Bronx, NY) and the Spring Valley (NY) branch of the NAACP, coordinated by our dedicated project educator and outreach specialist. <br/><br/>Reducing uncertainties in ice-sheet model predictions is crucial in society?s handling of the sea level crisis. Uncertainties related to ice-sheet instability arise from limited observations, inadequate model representation of ice-sheet processes, and limited understanding of the complex interactions between the atmosphere, ocean, and ice sheets. How atmospheric and oceanic forcing vary through time, and at what timescales each are capable of forcing rapid change, are critical for predicting future ice mass loss, but scientists have been observing ice sheet change for only a short period of time (decades). The PIs propose to scrutinize Greenland Ice Sheet change spanning from the beginning of the Holocene (12,000 years ago) to 2100 CE, making it possible to evaluate the varying roles of atmospheric and ocean forcing on decadal-to-centennial timescales relevant for the future Greenland Ice Sheet evolution. The PIs will utilize their established multi-disciplinary collaboration to combine ice sheet modelling, climate forcing and reconstructions of past ice-sheet change. This will position the team to make predictions of future ice sheet change that are grounded in Greenland Ice Sheet behavior during past climate swings that occurred prior to our brief window of modern observation. The work will lead to lasting products to serve the community's collective effort to better understand ice sheet change: 1) a state-of-the-art ice-sheet model optimized for simulations over long timescales, 2) a Holocene-through-modern set of atmospheric and ocean state estimates optimized for forcing an ice-sheet model, and 3) a database of past-ice sheet configurations and paleoclimate records formatted for model-data comparison.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the effects of temperature on important cellular processes including protein synthesis and nutrient uptake remain poorly understood. Resolution of this longstanding and hotly debated puzzle is essential for developing a better understanding of how organisms respond to long-term changes in environmental temperature. Here, the investigators will address this issue for two groups of bacteria from extreme environments that have independently adapted to high temperatures. The approach will combine the extension of recently developed theory with the novel application of new technologies for monitoring protein synthesis. This research will provide a general predictive framework with the potential to transform our understanding of the evolution of thermal physiology. The investigators will also integrate research and education through mentoring and outreach at both K-12 and university levels. Graduate students will be trained to communicate their research to the general public, increasing the outreach efforts to the community. Modules on effect of temperature on biological systems will be developed and presented at different venues to reach a broad spectrum of K-12 students. Finally, underrepresented students will be involved in all aspects of this research.<br/><br/>Understanding the links between temperature, metabolism and fitness remains a fundamental challenge in evolutionary physiology. The longstanding debate over the relative importance of thermodynamic effects on physiological rates versus biochemical adaptation for the temperature dependence of organism performance has been particularly contentious. To better distinguish among alternative mechanisms that may contribute to the evolution of thermal performance, the PI proposes to extend recently developed theory on the interdependence of microbial growth rate and gene expression to investigate how temperature effects on fitness arise from both thermodynamic effects on metabolic rates and cell allocation trade-offs between protein synthesis and nutrient metabolism. Growth theory models will determine the relationship between growth rate and resource allocation at different temperatures for ecologically divergent members of two clades of thermophilic cyanobacteria that have convergently radiated along geothermal gradients. Further, characterization of ribosome activity with a next-generation sequencing approach will connect the organism-level phenomena described by the models with their underlying molecular mechanisms of gene expression. The experimental design will enable the determination of the relative contributions of temperature effects on physiological rates versus temperature-compensating, adaptive mechanisms for the evolution of thermal performance. It will improve on existing theory by simultaneously accounting for both the temperature effects on metabolic rates and the constraints imposed on growth by finite cellular resources, thereby enabling improved predictions for how gene expression, metabolism and fitness change along an organism's thermal niche. Together, the research will provide a fresh perspective on the mechanisms that drive niche differentiation and thermal specialization. The educational impacts of these research will also involve training and mentoring of students from the postdoctoral level to K-12 and include students from underrepresented populations.<br/><br/>This project is co-funded by the Integrative Ecological Physiology Program in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems and by the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Climate change is increasing the frequency of such events and heightening the imperative to understand their drivers and landscape responses and to translate such understanding into hazards reduction. In mid-June 2022, extreme floods on the Yellowstone River and many of its tributaries in and around northern Yellowstone National Park were generated by an atmospheric river that delivered 2.5?10 cm of rain to high-elevation snowpack. Large rain-on-snow floods have created large and persistent channel changes in Yellowstone in the past, and they may become more common in a warming climate. The extreme June 2022 event provides a rare opportunity to examine its magnitude and effects on Yellowstone River tributaries. This project will support research experiences for five undergraduate students and one M.S. student and represents a new collaboration between primarily undergraduate-serving and very high research activity institutions. The project will contribute to National Park Service after-event analysis and planning. The investigators will engage broad audiences through social media. Project findings will be incorporated into university classes.<br/><br/>This research aims to reconstruct flood hydraulics and assess the hydrogeomorphic effects of the June 2022 event, to contextualize the impacts relative to previous extreme flooding events, and to inform geohazards planning at Yellowstone National Park. These goals will be accomplished by targeted field surveys, geomorphic change analysis over larger areas using repeat lidar, and hydraulic modeling. The investigators' efforts will focus on areas that are both well-suited to the research questions and have pre-flood data. Research objectives include estimating the hydraulics of the June 2022 flood and how the flood affected channel geometry and floodplain character, including incision and/or aggradation of Yellowstone River tributaries. The research is time sensitive and urgent because landscape changes induced by the floods are most evident in the immediate aftermath, before subsequent rainfall events in 2022 and the spring 2023 snowmelt runoff season further rework fluvial systems and floodplains.

NNA projects address convergence scientific challenges in the rapidly changing Arctic. This Arctic research is needed to inform the economy, security and resilience of the Nation, the larger region and the globe. NNA empowers new research partnerships from local to international scales, diversifies the next generation of Arctic researchers, enhances efforts in formal and informal education, and integrates the co-production of knowledge where appropriate. This award fulfills part of that aim by addressing interactions among the natural environment and built environment in the following NNA focus areas: Arctic Residents, Data and Observation, Forecasting, and Global Impact.<br/><br/>The most abundant large animal in the Arctic is caribou (Rangifer tarandus). Caribou have significant influences on social and natural systems. These animals perform the longest terrestrial migrations on Earth in herds of up to half a million individuals. Caribou are central to the spiritual and material culture of Indigenous peoples across the North. In many communities, food security depends directly on caribou presence. Caribou are also an important part of Arctic ecosystems through their impact on forest and tundra. It is therefore extremely concerning that global caribou numbers have declined over recent decades, with some herds collapsing by over 95% since 1990. These declines are likely related to the many environmental changes occurring in the Arctic, but the true causes are unknown. This research follows the leadership of Indigenous communities and other stakeholders to directly address the future of caribou across northern Alaska and Canada. The project trains students and postdoctoral fellows at several U.S. universities, contributing to a strong STEM workforce. Results are disseminated broadly, and data are accessible to the public, including valuable new spatial data products and visualizations. Understanding caribou decline is one of the most pressing concerns in the Arctic, and this project provides data to inform decision-making on the management of a vital resource.  <br/><br/>This project tests hypotheses that relate specific climatic and ecological relationships to the movements of populations of migratory caribou. The hypotheses are directly informed by local observations and the immediate concerns of affected communities. Several relevant changes in Arctic environments include: tundra vegetation, snow quality and quantity, fire regimes, insect harassment, and impacts of built environments. The analyses use an unprecedented compilation of caribou monitoring and satellite collar tracking data amassed by partners in territorial and federal agencies across northern Alaska and Canada, combined with Indigenous Knowledge and remote sensing of vegetation, fire, snow, and land-cover. Strong, well-established relationships with Arctic community partners, including Indigenous-led co-management governance boards and government agencies, enable a broad knowledge base. By leveraging an enormous collaborative network, it is possible to compare and contrast caribou populations, highlighting both fundamental processes and local particularities of relevant interactions. The ultimate outcome will be the ability to generally anticipate the fate of caribou as the Arctic continues to change.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Male rhinoceros beetles wield a giant, pitchfork-shaped horn on their head that they use in battles between rival males over feeding territories visited by females. Males with the longest horns win, in part because horn length accurately reflects body size and fighting ability of males - it is an honest signal of male quality. Prior work by the investigators revealed that winning fights is not enough, however. Even after battling to hold a territory, males must still spend hours each night ""singing"" to females using a novel file on their wing covers that they rub against a plate on their abdomen, and they produce blends of scents in their waxy outer cuticle that appear to communicate male body size and nutritional state. This study will explore the link between male condition and both song and scent signals, examine female preferences for these signals, and characterize the diversification of this suite of courtship signals across the range of the species. How do females discriminate among males, and why do they ignore the obvious signal of male quality (the horn)? The investigators will also work with the Gonzaga department of dance to design performances inspired by animal behavior, develop an interactive exhibit on insect songs for the Missoula Insectarium, and design interactive online curricula for K-16 students through the University of Denver to share information about beetles with the public.   <br/><br/>Prior work on the Japanese rhinoceros beetle, Trypoxylus dichotomus, a heavily weaponed species characterized by a textbook resource defense mating system, led the investigators to suspect that these beetles show elements of lekking behavior. Females are reluctant to mate with resident males guarding feeding territories despite those males consistently being among the largest, longest-horned individuals in the population. Using a combination of laboratory manipulation experiments and field observation and perturbations, this study will rigorously characterize stridulatory song and cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) profile signals in rhinoceros beetles (Aim 1), and evaluate their importance to female mate choice (Aim 2) and male rival assessment during contests (Aim 3). In addition, this study will compare song dialects and CHC profiles across the range of this species (Aim 4), to contrast the relative rates of evolution of agonistic and mate-choice signals. Finally, they will perform a quantitative trait locus mapping study of adjacent, genetically similar but phenotypically divergent populations, combining the resulting linkage maps with a re-sequenced reference genome, and FST 'outlier' results from a prior PoolSeq study of the same populations, to delve into the genetic architecture of this suite of multimodal signal traits.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When their ranges overlap, the different species can hybridize with one another. The goal of the research is to understand whether hybrid chickadees have less efficient metabolisms and reduced survival when compared with non-hybrid chickadees. If hybrids have low survival this may help maintain separate species. Members of the public will be critical parts of the project.

This project bridges traditional disciplinary boundaries in Earth and water sciences to generate new knowledge about the storage and flow of water through mountain watersheds. Mountainous regions of the world receive extensive precipitation and serve as crucial year-round sources of freshwater for human populations and natural ecosystems. Standard methods for estimating the total amount of water stored within mountain watersheds involve single-point measurements with limited spatial coverage or large-scale averages over hundreds of kilometers with limited resolution. Recent advances in geophysics, including the development and expansion of global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) that measure subtle changes in the shape of the Earth caused by the weight of groundwater and surface water, have transformed the ability to study Earth?s water cycle, especially at space and time scales that are relevant to complex mountain watersheds. By precisely observing and modeling the centimeter-scale deformation of Earth due to fluctuations in mountain snow and water storage, this project aims to place new constraints on hydrologic models at the watershed scale, create enhanced operational tools for water-resource management, and develop a prototype hydrologic early-warning system that can alert downstream communities to flood risk or flash droughts. Furthermore, demonstrating the capability to make estimates of water storage at individual watersheds using a few inexpensive GNSS sensors could change the way that freshwater resources are typically measured and managed.<br/><br/>This project combines fieldwork, data analysis, and modeling to investigate three hydrologically distinct mountain watersheds in the western USA. High-resolution (in space and time) observations of crustal displacement, streamflow, snow depth, precipitation, and atmospheric conditions will be collected in all three watersheds. Research products will include: (1) empirical calibrations that relate GNSS-inferred surface displacements to hydrologic parameters such as streamflow and aquifer recharge; (2) numerical tools for forward modeling of three-dimensional surface displacements due to heterogeneous loads on a heterogeneous Earth and for inverse modeling to calculate variations in water storage within the watershed; (3) coupled geodetic and hydrologic models that incorporate critical feedbacks between solid-Earth deformation, water storage, surface runoff, and groundwater flow; and (4) a pilot operational product for hydrologic forecasting.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research will expand the emerging field of socio-hydrology (the study of the feedbacks between human decisions and water systems) by focusing on how land-use choices made by farmers influence water availability and thus alter the productivity of agricultural land.  Understanding the relationships between land-use change, water, and agriculture is crucial to balancing tradeoffs between the environmental costs associated with converting forests and other natural habitats to crop fields and pasture, and the need to increase food production to meet growing demands as global populations and incomes rise. This project will contribute to the health and welfare of the United States and elsewhere by informing choices about how to increase agricultural output while limiting impacts on water, atmosphere and biodiversity.  It will enhance research and education infrastructure by expanding a scientifically relevant and publicly-available dataset linking a survey of farm households to data and models of land and water use.  Lastly, it will develop capacity in interdisciplinary research through the training of students and postdoctoral researchers.<br/><br/>Land-use decisions of individual farmers can aggregate up to landscape-level changes that influence the regional hydroclimate in ways that alter the availability of water for agricultural production, including both soil moisture or 'green' water and surface/ground or 'blue' water.  How farmers adjust their investment and land-use decisions in response to water scarcity has implications for agricultural productivity and ultimately the supply of agricultural commodities.  This project will advance basic scientific knowledge of the dynamic feedbacks among agricultural production choices, regional environmental variability, and vulnerability to water stress.  It will address questions of how environmental variability and land-use changes affect the regional hydroclimate and property-level green and blue water; the extent to which individual farmers are vulnerable to variation in green and blue water and how they adapt; and how inter-related farmer production decisions aggregate to determine water, land-use, production and welfare outcomes under different policy scenarios.  Data from a unique long-term household panel survey (1996-2018) will be combined with data and models of land cover, climate and hydrology to understand the effects of the regional hydroclimate on property-level water availability and the effects of water availability on agricultural production decisions.  Analysis of the property-level empirical relationships will inform an agent-based model (ABM) that will be linked with a regional climate model to assess the aggregate consequences of these feedbacks for land-use, agricultural output and welfare.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to harness HHG to better understand the chemistry of transition metal compounds, which are essential in various chemical processes and have extensive industrial applications. Transition metal compounds have intriguing properties, partly due to their complex electronic structures. By exploring the HHG spectra of transition metal compounds, this research contributes to advancing our understanding of these materials, which can have wide-ranging implications for innovations in chemistry and materials science. Additionally, this project includes educational components that will serve the national interest by training the next generation of scientists. It integrates cutting-edge research into classrooms and actively engages undergraduate students, providing them with invaluable experience. Through collaborations with local schools, this project also seeks to inspire younger students and foster a community-wide appreciation for science.<br/><br/>This project focuses on examining the HHG spectra of transition metal compounds containing carbonyl, cyanide, and chloride groups. The study employs time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations to investigate several compounds such as Ni(CO)4, V(CO)6, Ni(CN)2, Ni(CN)4^3-, and NiCl4^2-. The analyses will encompass understanding the variations in the HHG spectra in terms of the metal's properties, ligands, spin states, and coordination geometries. Furthermore, the project will probe the deviations from the high harmonic cutoff law, analyze resonance-enhanced high harmonic emissions below the ionization potential, and explore charge transfer between the metal and ligands. This comprehensive approach will help in understanding how the phase relations of multiple electrons on different trajectories can deviate from the single-active-electron (SAE) predictions in transition metal compounds. Moreover, it involves systematic benchmarking and improvement of the TDDFT methods developed by the PI and collaborators, which can further deepen insights into complex electronic structures and multi-electron dynamics in transition metal compounds.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics Theory Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This task is computationally difficult: glacier models are expensive, particularly when it can take months or years to run the many thousands of simulations required to completely characterize possible outcomes. However, understanding this distribution is essential in meeting the grand challenge of building a sustainable future. This project will use deep learning to construct surrogate models, replacements for ice sheet model components that approximate the original model, but which are much less computationally costly. In addition, this project will convene a summer school and develop educational models to integrate the research and educational components of the work. <br/><br/>In particular, this project will use geometric and generative deep learning in tandem with novel applications of classic techniques in high-performance computing to build an approximate (or surrogate) model that is hundreds of times faster than traditional ice sheet models. Such a speedup will in turn allow researchers to explore an unprecedented range of future scenarios and meet the challenges of ice modeling for understanding future global impacts. In addition, a nine-day summer school will bring together instructors and students from around the globe to learn and share effective methods for applying deep learning to problems in glaciology.

To understand the effects that shifting climates have on organisms, scientists must investigate how individuals respond to new environmental challenges, and how those responses alter species? distributions and their evolution. High-elevation, montane ecosystems (~2,500 meters above sea level) are especially vulnerable to climate change, and numerous high-elevation species have experienced changes in their distributions or have gone extinct altogether. This project will test whether a flesh macroparasite, Cuterebra botflies, will expand into higher elevations with a warming climate, and whether this expansion will negatively impact high-elevation populations of one of its hosts, the North American deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) that currently do not encounter botflies. Data from this project will be used to develop new curricula for middle school students focused on analyzing and interpreting real data, as well as a series of YouTube videos aimed to increase understanding of the effects of climate change on biodiversity.<br/><br/>The vulnerability of high-elevation species may result from their generally narrow ranges and the unrelentingly strong abiotic selection pressures inherent to these environments, which reduces a population?s genetic and phenotypic variation. At elevations near sea-level, infections with botfly larvae have pronounced influences on deer mouse physiology, but not on performance or survival. At moderate elevations however (~2,000 meters above sea level), however, botfly infections severely limit physiological function, over-winter survival and the ability of mice to perform ecologically relevant tasks. This project will combine field physiology along a steep elevational gradient (~sea level to >4,000 m asl) with demographic modeling, experimental manipulations, and genome re-sequencing to determine the consequences of ongoing and novel interactions between botflies and their deer mouse hosts across their broad elevational range. The data will be used predict future demographic consequences of botfly infection on deer mouse populations under climate change.

About 90% of ice sheet is covered by compacted snow that is slowly transitioning into glacier ice. This aged and dense snow is called ?firn? and forms a porous layer that is many tens of meters thick. Much of the meltwater generated from the surface of the firn layer infiltrates into the underlying open pore space of the firn and refreezes. However, as this porous layer absorbs more melt it becomes warmer, denser, and filled with ice layers, which reduces its ability to absorb additional melt. Therefore, the thermal and structural transformation that Greenland's firn layer is presently undergoing has important implications for the ice sheet's capacity to retain future melt. This project is directly observing firn evolution with a network of instruments installed within the firn layer and with ice cores sampling the firn. The observational data collected by this project provides on-the-ground documentation of firn conditions needed to develop and test models and remote sensing tools for large-scale investigations of changes to the Greenland ice sheet. Future transformation of the firn layer will govern how much surface melt is retained locally on the ice sheet and how much runs off, thereby impacting hydrologic conditions of the ice sheet and surrounding regions, ocean salinity, and sea level rise.<br/><br/>The researchers will install and maintain an observation network along a transect of the Greenland ice sheet to directly measure the state and transformation of firn properties. Repeat sampling of firn cores and instrumentation extending from the surface to 25 meters depth will yield the observational datasets needed by multiple scientific communities: firn temperature, density and ice content, densification rate, surface boundary processes (radiation, snow accumulation, temperature), and ice velocity. The network will yield 4-5 full-year records in this five-year Arctic Observing Network project. The project will provide comprehensive datasets for process-level investigations, testing climate model simulations of firn processes, and interpreting satellite-based measurement of surface elevation change. The project will engage and support a relatively large number of undergraduate and graduate students at R2 institutions with field research experiences and real-world classroom learning. Outreach activities will target three groups poorly represented in cryospheric science: 1) local and Indigenous residents of Greenland; 2) American Indian undergraduate students; and 3) economically disadvantaged school children.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Tree seedlings establish during the first few years after fire, and young trees reach their peak growth within the first few decades. Rapid tree growth is partly fueled by nitrogen (N), a critical plant nutrient. However, some of the N stored in forests is lost to the atmosphere via combustion during forest fires. How this lost ecosystem N is replenished after high-severity fires is not known, especially where nitrogen-fixing plants (such as legumes) that can convert atmospheric N to biologically available N, are rare. Historically, western conifer forests have recovered from fire long before they burn again. Whether more frequent high-severity fires will further reduce ecosystem N and affect forest recovery is not known. Building on long-term research since the 1988 Yellowstone Fires, this research aims to identify and quantify the sources of N recovery in young postfire lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia) forests and to determine how ecosystem N responds to more frequent fire. The researchers will engage journalism students to communicate their findings to broad audiences and develop new approaches for teaching students about N in forest ecosystems. <br/><br/>Biological N fixation (BNF) is the likeliest source of the new N needed to sustain postfire stand development, and the researchers hypothesize that the new N inputs reflect the combined activity of multiple inconspicuous N sources. Using field observations and a multi-year N-fertilization experiment in Greater Yellowstone (Wyoming, USA), this study will address three questions: (1) What are the sources and rates of N inputs in aggrading lodgepole pine forests (< 40 yrs postfire), and how do sources and rates vary with stand structure and time since fire? (2) How does N availability regulate N fixation and N limitation in aggrading young (< 40 yr) lodgepole pine forests with increasing time since fire? (3) How do short-interval (< 30 yr) stand-replacing fires affect N fixation, N availability, and N stocks? This research will test expectations that total N fixation rates will increase with lodgepole pine biomass and N stocks, and that sources of biological N fixation will shift from symbiotic to cryptic, free-living N fixers as tree demand increases over time and across space. These well-integrated studies will directly address critical unknowns that constrain the ability to anticipate the future of western forests as fire activity accelerates.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is not due to lack of carbon dioxide, whose concentration in the atmosphere has been on the increase.  Rather, it is due to the growth-limiting effects caused by the lack of other available nutrients in soil,  especially nitrogen and phosphorous.  Nevertheless, computer ecosystem models used to estimate the response of plants to increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide predict that this environmental change will result in more rapid and abundant plant growth globally. Such models fail to incorporate the effects of other limiting nutrients on plant growth. This project will bring together experimental scientists and computer modelers to explore the effects of nutrients on plant growth, determine whether nutrient supplies are adequate to promote the growth predicted by models, and decide how to best represent the effects of nutrients in global computer models. Research coordination via this network is important for establishing how the carbon cycle is likely to change in response to global environmental change, with important implications for soil fertility and agriculture.  The project will train multiple early career scientists, foster a number of diverse international collaborations, and engage with broad audiences using multiple scientific and social media platforms.<br/><br/>The proposed Research Coordination Network (INCyTE) will bring together two communities that historically have not interacted closely: biogeochemical experimentalists and earth system modelers. The overarching goals of INCyTE are to enhance our understanding of nutrient cycling feedbacks on the global carbon (C) cycle in general, and to integrate different investigators, data, and experimental and conceptual frameworks to improve representation of nutrient interactions and constraints on the global terrestrial C cycle in Earth System Models (ESMs). While nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus and others) have the potential to mediate plant growth responses to elevated carbon dioxide (and interact with a host of other global changes), only a handful of current global simulation models even attempt to represent those interactions and feedbacks. This project will: 1) Identify gaps in understanding/representation of modeled C-nutrients feedbacks and processes; 2) Coordinate a number of small-scale, coummunity-based, high-throughput experiments to address particular hypotheses and identify candidate processes for further attention; 3) Use network syntheses and community-based experimental data to enhance model representation of nutrient cycling; and 4) Employ new ESM inter-comparisons.

Locked in the trees and soil, this carbon is sequestered from the atmosphere. But as the climate warms, fires are becoming more and more common ? and while wildfire is not unusual in the boreal, the increasing frequency of burning is surpassing what the forests have evolved to tolerate, leading to forest loss and permafrost thaw. We do not know what comes next. It is possible that if the forest fails to recover from high frequency fires, grasses and shrubs may take over, further increasing flammability. Or they may dampen future fire activity. This project takes a unique look at fires in the boreal, by investigating the deep history of fire through lake sediment cores where you can see the history of fire over thousands of years, through fieldwork to determine how resilient the landscape is now, and through high-performance computer models to estimate how fires will behave in the future. The project spans many timescales and pushes computing powers to the limit and will inform expectations of the future for this biome and the planet. The project will train graduate students, undergraduate students, and postdoctoral scholars, organize a two-day science communication workshop, and refine a fire teaching model used to teach high schoolers about carbon-vegetation-fire interactions.<br/> <br/>Using an integrative and dynamic approach, this project will combine existing and newly collected sediment data to explore the paleohistory of short interval fires in the boreal with co-located fieldwork in short-interval fire areas. Although it is known that modern fire frequency is passing historical norms, this project will go further, to determine if current short interval fires are creating novel structures. Those structures are the basis for fire behavior in the future, so the researchers will then combine those measurements with modern, physics-based fluid dynamics modeling of fire behavior that can simulate wind in close canopies and in novel forest structures Further, this model will be extended to incorporate soil effects, critical in the boreal. This is the only available way to explore the fire implications of truly novel species assemblages and structures that seem to be emerging. Together, this work will explore fire likelihood feedbacks and structural thresholds associated with fire behavior in the boreal forest and inform expectations about how the region will respond, in terms of wildfire and energy balance, to climate warming.

For this reason, it is important to understand what happens to CO2 after it is emitted into the atmosphere ? does it stay in the atmosphere or is some of it taken up by the oceans or land? The complex group of processes that control CO2 in the environment is called the carbon cycle. The Arctic Ocean is a region where the carbon cycle is not very well understood. Sea surface warming and loss of sea ice are rapidly changing the Arctic Ocean but it is unclear how these changes affect the carbon cycle and ocean acidification (the decrease in ocean pH due to the formation of carbonic acid when CO2 dissolves in water). Scientists need more information to understand these changes but research accessibility in the Arctic is limited. It is a harsh environment, dark, and very cold for much of the year and where icebreakers are typically required to do ocean measurements. Hence, most Arctic Ocean studies are made only during the summer period when work conditions are feasible. This project overcomes these limitations by deploying autonomous sensors on moorings and drifters. Three moorings will be placed in the Canada Basin of the Arctic Ocean with CO2, pH and other sensors. Drifters will also be deployed with CO2 sensors suspended below the ice. These sensors will provide valuable data throughout the year for understanding the carbon cycle and how it is changing. The project will also make all these data available to the research community and other stakeholders. <br/><br/>The specific goal of the study is to continue to operate an Arctic Observing Network (AON) for the measurement of the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2), pH, and dissolved O2 (DO) focused on the surface waters of the Arctic Ocean (specifically, the Canada Basin). The grant will support participation in the Beaufort Gyre Observing System (BGOS) project that includes annual cruises on the Canadian icebreaker, the CCGS Louis S. St-Laurent.

These high temporal resolution, long-term measurements will be used to quantify air-sea CO2 fluxes, the rate of ocean acidification, and to understand to what extent changing seasonal ice formation regulates sea surface pCO2. These data will also be used to improve coupled physical-biogeochemical models of the Arctic Ocean.

The pattern of deformation depends on the weight and distribution of the fluids as well as on the structural properties of Earth?s interior. Thus, observations and models of Earth deformation caused by repeated cycles of surface loading and unloading can shed light on important Earth-system processes, including mantle dynamics, the water cycle, and changes in climate. For well-known loads, such as the ocean tides, investigations of surface loading can place key constraints on allowable models for the density structure and mechanical behavior of Earth?s crust and mantle, which can advance understanding of mantle convective processes that drive plate tectonics and surface hazards. Furthermore, tracking load-induced Earth deformation allows for the quantification of changes in freshwater storage over the continents, which can aid in drought monitoring and water-resource management. This project aims to advance both observational and computational methods for analyzing how the Earth deforms under the weight of water and air at the surface. Recent studies suggest that the observational precision of state-of-the-art satellite positioning systems, including the Global Positioning System (GPS), may now exceed the predictive capabilities of current Earth-deformation models that commonly assume spherically symmetric Earth structure. Thus, a major objective of this project will be to leverage new advances in computational technologies and geophysical software to investigate the impacts of three-dimensional (3-D) variations in Earth structure (i.e., topography, polar flattening due to rotation, and lateral variations in internal structure) on load-induced Earth deformation. By making predictive models of surface loading more accurate, and by packaging computational tools in a way that the broader scientific community can use with greater ease, this project aims to refine existing models of Earth structure, improve estimates of freshwater storage over the continents, and promote collaborative efforts that drive innovation in geophysics. With computational methods becoming more sophisticated, resources that support and enhance the computational literacy of early-career scientists will become ever more critical to workforce development and sustained innovation. This project will produce a series of computational short courses that can be delivered to students, postdoctoral scholars, and the broader scientific community in flexible formats. This project will also facilitate graduate-undergraduate mentoring and professional-development programs as well as generate open educational resources. <br/><br/>A primary objective of this project is to quantify the influence of 3-D variations in solid-Earth structure, including topography and internal contrasts in material properties, on surface displacements caused by ocean tidal loading and continental water loading. This project will analyze data products from Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and develop models to predict the response of a 3-D Earth to cycles of surface loading and unloading. Research products will include: (1) sensitivity and resolution analyses that quantify the ability to constrain 3-D Earth structure using GNSS; (2) quantitative assessments of the impacts of 3-D Earth structure on estimates of ocean tidal loading and continental water storage; (3) empirical estimates of load tides from GNSS data; (4) open-source software tools that facilitate tidal analysis and the inversion of geodetic data for Earth structure; and (5) refined models for Earth structure constrained by GNSS observations of load tides.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Their unique value comes from the high-quality information they contain and the documentation indicating how they were collected.  Of particular value are trait measurements that document how species interact with each other and how they vary though time, for example, when responding to environmental changes. Unfortunately, traits for museum specimens are often only available in non-digital and non-standard formats. This limits the ability of researchers to find and use them to their full potential. This award will establish the Ranges Digitization Network (?Ranges?). The goal of the network is to digitize traits from over one million mammal specimens in 19 U.S. natural history museums. The network will produce datasets that are in standard format and easy to find in online biodiversity platforms, such as iDigBio. This will allow researchers to build better baselines for biodiversity and improve predictions of how mammals respond to changing environments. Ranges will also spark collaboration among the museum community and data scientists, creating solutions usable broadly. The network will employ a diverse human workforce in digitization and research tasks, and it will engage the public through citizen science activities and museum exhibits. This will address a major remaining digitization challenge for U.S. museums, to expand utility of specimens and use them to create new scientific knowledge. <br/><br/>Digitization of U.S. natural history museums over the past two decades has improved data sharing and research capacity in the life sciences. Among the most important data associated with museum specimens are the morphological and reproductive traits of individuals. These traits are informative about ecology, evolution, and responses of organisms to environmental change. Unfortunately, traits from specimens remain incompletely digitized across museums and hard to locate on the internet. This inhibits their discovery and use at a time of pressing global change. Ranges will digitize and publish traits from approximately 1.2 million non-marine mammal specimens from western North America. The project focuses on this region due to its complex topography and climate, and because it is a center of mammalian biodiversity. The specific goals of the network are to extend existing software tools, develop new standards for mammal trait data, and coordinate digitization across museum partners. New, digital trait data on biodiversity data platforms such as iDigBio will transform data accessibility and foster new evolutionary, ecological, and biomedical research. Ranges will also collaborate with the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) to ensure compatibility with trait data collected throughout the lifetime of that network. Using the above approaches, Ranges will lay a foundation for building an extended specimen network for mammals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There are many other ways they protect themselves, too. Ecologists have wondered for a long time why different species of plants adopt very different strategies of protection. Why wouldn't there be one best way? Even different individuals of the same species defend themselves differently.  Thus, a major challenge in ecology is to figure out the causes and consequences of differences in plant defense.  One idea is that plants in places where they can't grow fast, can invest more energy in defense.  In contrast, plants in places with lots of water and nutrients can grow and reproduce quickly -- life is good, so they don't need as much defense. Scientists with this project will test that idea. They will look at how different individuals of the same species may change their strategies of defense when grown in stressful areas and areas of plenty. They will test how well the defenses work by measuring how tasty the plants are to insects. Results may reveal new strategies for protection of farm crops from insect pests. The researchers will involve high school and college students in the project, training them how to do science. Also, the public will be engaged through various natural history and conservation programs.<br/><br/>This project involves reciprocally transplanting six co-occurring native grassland plant species from populations replicated within eight high- and eight low-resource environments into common gardens located in each region. Resources (rainfall) will also be manipulated in a common garden located in the low-resource region to evaluate the extent to which responses of plant growth and defense to abiotic factors are plastic. Herbivore abundance and the impacts of herbivores on plant fitness (accessed via insect-reduction experiments) will be quantified within populations containing the focal species across the two resource regions. Collectively, these experiments will evaluate how the resource environment influences: 1) growth and defense (both tolerance and resistance) evolution and plasticity within species; 2) positive growth and defense correlations across populations, and 3) insect herbivore abundance and the impacts of herbivory on plant fitness. Ultimately, the multispecies approach employed will help to reconcile the different growth-defense relationships often observed among vs. within species.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This, in turn, can help to better understand today?s shifts and changes that have been brought about by the movement of individuals and mixing of cultures which occur so frequently. Radiocarbon dating for samples from the sites will also allow for refining the history of the region and modeling cultural changes and dynamics. Additionally, two students will attend a month-long summer course that will introduce them to the field of ancient DNA and the required laboratory techniques. Due to the lack of widespread ancient DNA facilities, this will allow for helpful training and grounding for future work and collaboration. <br/><br/>Because the world has always been connected through the movement of people, exchange of goods, and sharing of cultural traits, the evidence of such can be found within the genomes of individuals as well as in the archaeological sites they leave behind.

They are also home to a vast array of plant and animal life, all of which play important roles in maintaining the balance of the ecosystem. Like all ecosystems, however, forests are increasingly threatened by biodiversity loss and climate change. Though these changes can disrupt the complex interactions among species that make forests function properly, we still have a limited understanding of these cascading impacts. This study takes advantage of a unique natural experiment to investigate how the loss of a key species ? the bearded pig ? affects the health of a tropical rain forest in Borneo. The bearded pig was once a common animal in this ecosystem, playing a vital role in seed predation, herbivory, and nutrient cycling, but was recently wiped out by an introduced disease. This project will use a combination of field observations, experiments, and modeling to understand how the loss of bearded pigs has affected the ecosystem. Research results will be disseminated to non-governmental organizations and policy-makers involved in biodiversity assessment and conservation. The project will also generate outreach materials to educate the public and K-12 students about ecological functions and how they are affected by global changes.<br/><br/> Specifically, the research has three main objectives. First, it will assess how the loss of bearded pigs affects the survival and growth of tree seedlings. Pigs played a key role in tree regeneration by eating the seeds of many plant species. Researchers will repeat a number of exclosure experiments conducted when pigs were abundant to determine how pigs and other seed-destroying consumers like rodents, insects, and fungi affect seed fates, and whether these other groups compensate for the lost effects of pigs. This will help elucidate how extirpation of an important mammal species affects the regeneration of multiple tree species. Second, the research will determine how the loss of bearded pigs and climate change combine to affect the amount of carbon stored by the forest over time. By affecting regeneration of large trees with high wood density more than other types of trees, bearded pigs are thought to have influenced overall forest carbon storage in ways that are now changing after the species? loss. Such ecosystem changes might become even more severe as the forest starts to experience more frequent and severe droughts. Using integral projection models parameterized with extensive observational and experimental data, researchers will examine the population trajectories of numerous tree species that vary in adult size, wood density, and other traits important for carbon storage. Finally, the research will ascertain how the loss of bearded pigs affects other animals in the forest. Pigs were an important food source for predators like clouded leopards, they competed with other herbivores like deer for food, and they potentially even affected birds and bats by competing with (and reducing the abundance of) seed-eating insects. Using occurrence and abundance data spanning the last decade, researchers will examine whether the loss of pigs is changing the abundance of these other important animals in the rain forest.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by Population and Community Ecology, the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and Ecosystem Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While there are some basic similarities in rhythm and intonation patterns across languages, there are also interesting differences.  Some of these differences are linked to the way words are structured in languages, for example, are the words short or are they composed of many sub-parts.   This project investigates and documents the rhythm and intonation, or prosodic system, of under-documented languages to better understand how humans modulate pitch movement (i.e. intonation) and segmental duration (i.e. the length of vowels and consonants).  The project uses archived and new recordings to arrive at acoustic measurements and visualizations of pitch and duration, creating a database that can be mined for the study of the interplay of prosody and other domains such as the syllable, word, foot, prosodic word, prosodic phrase, and intonation unit. The project includes training for graduate students and undergraduate students from Aaniiih Nakoda College.<br/><br/>The investigators mine archived recordings or new recordings of words, phrases and connected speech produced by native speakers to improve and understand the prosodic system of the morphologically complex languages for analysis. They represent their findings through the software in development by the team for this purpose.  A major product of this project is a database with phonetic analyses across different prosodic domains, e.g, the syllable or word.  These materials will be made available through an online webservice and will be useful for researchers working to analyze and represent other languages with significant modulations of pitch and duration.

Therefore, it is urgent to understand how species diversity affects infectious diseases in wildlife. In some ecosystems, increasing diversity of competitor species decreases disease risk, termed the 'dilution' effect because diversity dilutes out infection. However, in other systems, a more diverse community increases disease risk, termed the ?amplification? effect. When to expect dilution or amplification is a topic of debate among disease ecologists. This project aims to reconcile the competing effects of biodiversity using Sin Nombre hantavirus (SNV) in deer mice as a model. This system displays aspects of both dilution and amplification at the same time. This project lays out a framework for examining potential mechanisms of dilution and amplification and how they can interact to potentially be synergistic or antagonistic. This will facilitate moving beyond the long-standing debate of which pattern (dilution or amplification) is more prevalent, clarifying when different mechanisms may be dominant and help explain the different patterns seen in various studies. It will also benefit society by advancing prevention efforts for hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). This human illness caused by SNV, has affected more than 700 people (killing more than 250) since its discovery in 1993. Other broader Impacts of this research include outreach and work with Native Americans, with particular focus on K-12 outreach. <br/><br/>Three mechanisms determine if increasing competitor diversity will lead to dilution or amplification of a directly transmitted pathogen. Dilution will occur if increased species diversity leads to 1) decreased host density, 2) decreased contact rates, or 3) decreased probability of transmission given contact (transmissibility). Conversely, amplification could occur if increased diversity does the opposite. This project develops a framework to disentangle these component dilution and amplification effects, centered around a mathematical model that combines SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) dynamics with a Lotka-Volterra competition coefficient. Aim 1 is to determine how increased small mammal diversity / composition affects mouse population demography and subsequent SNV prevalence, by performing Bayesian population analyses on longitudinal data. Aim 2 is to determine how increased small mammal diversity affects the transmission rate, through changes in transmissibility (via stress, co-infections, immunity, and viral shedding) and/or contact rates between deer mice, using a combination of long-term monitoring of physiology in natural populations, and experimental manipulation in the field. Aim 3 is to synthesize the findings from Aims 1 and 2 into a general model of how competitors can differentially affect all three components of transmission and scale up to determine the variety of observed patterns in disease prevalence within and across systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet migratory species are also declining worldwide because of human disturbance, habitat loss, and environmental variability.  In particular, large ungulates (e.g., deer, elk) are both ecologically and economically important (e.g., hunting), and yet their migrations are also in decline.  Understanding the causes of declining migratory ungulates has important implications for their conservation and management.  However, across migratory species, there are usually individuals who migrate and individuals who do not migrate within a single population.  Previous research also showed individual ungulates can be flexible in their migratory behavior, deciding whether to migrate or not, or where to migrate, based on changes in their environment. This research will take advantage of a 19-year, long-term study of migratory elk in a western North American montane landscape to understand both the causes of migratory decision-making in elk, as well as the population consequences of changes in migratory behavior to the management of elk. This research will have broad implications for population and habitat management for a wide range of economically-important migratory ungulate species such as deer and elk across western North America. <br/><br/>This research will extend our long-term 19-year demographic study of a partially migratory elk population on the border of Banff National Park, Alberta, to address the mechanisms driving partial migration.  The core data for this research is understanding the demography of over 400 individually marked female elk of known ages, their reproductive rates, and juvenile survival, combined with spatial analyses of their migratory behavior measured by Global Positioning System (GPS) collars. We will test whether elk switch between migratory strategies in a manner consistent with intrinsic factors (e.g. age, body condition), extrinsic factors (e.g, climate), or density-dependent mechanisms. By monitoring intrinsic factors such as age and reproductive history, as well as extrinsic variation in forage and predation risk, we will test amongst competing and interacting hypotheses to understand why a long-lived mammal switches between migratory strategies in the face of environmental change. We will then develop a flexible Bayesian integrated population model to test the consequences of migratory switching on population dynamics.

The Malaspina Glacier is currently rapidly thinning and retreating, forming a series of proglacial lakes along the bottom edge. Some of these lakes are only separated from the open ocean by a narrow band of sediment moraine. The underside of the glacier is located well below sea level and all current indications are that retreat and thinning will continue, and most likely accelerate, even with little future climate change. This has the potential to be the largest loss of ice in Alaska from one glacier in the next several decades. As the Malaspina Glacier retreats and thins it will transform the landscape, exposing more rocks and moraine, creating new lakes, and/or leading to significant changes in the coastline, such as the formation of marine fjords. If this happens, it will be one of the largest modern changes to Alaska?s and the nation?s coastline with large impacts to both terrestrial and marine ecosystems. These changes would also constitute the largest single change in terrestrial land cover in the National Park system in recent history.<br/><br/>The main goal of this work is to use a computer model to estimate what the future could look like for the Malaspina Glacier and surrounding area. Measurements collected in the field, on and around the glacier, will provide the necessary model input data. The work will result in a comprehensive data set on glacier mass balance, ice velocity, ice thickness, glacier bed conditions, surface debris extent and thickness, proglacial lake development, and proglacial thermokarst evolution. These data will be ingested into a numerical model that will be used to explore a large range of possible future scenarios for the evolution of Malaspina Glacier. The model scenarios will account for different climate trajectories as well as uncertainties of model parameters, such as those associated with hydrology and motion at the underside of the glacier. Specifically, the following questions will be addressed:<br/><br/>1. Is a pathway from the ocean to the glacier front critical for catastrophic retreat?<br/>2. Will the retreat of Malaspina be dominated by surface mass balance?<br/>3. What are the main uncertainties for model predictions?<br/><br/>This work will lead to a better understanding of how climate change interacts with dynamic instabilities that are independent of climate, in an area that has historically been characterized by large glacier fluctuations and spatial and temporal variability. While dynamically caused retreats are common for coastal glaciers, these effects are amplified in the presence of ongoing warming.<br/><br/>Malaspina Glacier is located in the Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and has the potential to help people envision the potentially dramatic effects of climate change on the Earth?s cryosphere. A graphic artist will convert the model results into striking visuals that show the opening up of a new landscape. Using an online message testing experiment, the project will test and develop outreach materials to increase visitor knowledge of ongoing and anticipated future glacier change and climate change. Visuals and associated information will become interactive exhibits that will engage thousands of visitors at the Wrangell-St. Elias National Park visitor center and online. In addition, this project will train three graduate students in relevant geophysical techniques, modern ice sheet modeling approaches, and collaborative research.

Such diversity affects the roles organisms play in key ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration and nutrient cycling. However, scientists don't yet have a complete understanding of the biological rules that dictate the proportions of C, N, and P in living things. One hypothesis is that C:N:P proportions are a function of how fast an organism grows because, to grow fast, organisms must produce P-rich structures to drive rapid construction of cellular materials. While various data support this view, other studies do not and so researchers do not yet know when this ""growth rate rule"" holds and when it doesn't. This project will subject three species (a bacterium, an alga, and a crustacean) to a variety of environmental and evolutionary conditions to see when C:N:P proportions of each organism follow this ""growth rate rule"" and when they don't. The research team will also build mathematical models of these processes to predict what happens when organisms that do (or do not) follow the growth rate rule interact with each other. The proposed research will advance scientific understanding how food webs and ecosystems work and improve predictions of how they respond to perturbations, including increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations and inputs of nitrogen and phosphorus pollution from agriculture and sewage. Furthermore, to help develop a broadly trained scientific work force, the project will partner with local tribal communities to engage Native American undergraduate students in the research.<br/><br/>This project seeks to establish the conditions under which there is or is not a close coupling among growth rate, C:N:P ratios, and cellular allocation to P-rich ribosomes in three taxa: Pseudomonas putida (a heterotrophic bacterium), Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (a photosynthetic alga), and Daphnia pulicaria (a crustacean consumer). First, Pseudomonas, Chlamydomonas, and Daphnia will be grown under limitation by key non-substitutable resources (energy, N, P). Associations among growth, biomass, excretion and remineralization C:N:P stoichiometry, cellular RNA and protein contents, and metabolic rates will be quantified. These measurements will be used to develop mathematical models of these cellular processes. Next, the project will complete a series of evolution experiments, subjecting Pseudomonas, Chlamydomonas, and Daphnia to selection under limitation by different resources. The resulting descendants will be assessed as in the first component of the project. Then, the descendants will be used in ecological experiments to evaluate how evolutionary responses affect ecological processes. Finally, results from these experiments will be used to develop and test new mathematical models of ecological and evolutionary dynamics.
