## THE DATA

Write a summary of the data sources you have used. Include a Data Dictionary table that fully describes each individual data source used. You may supplement the data supplied to you with additional sources if you like, but this is not required.

### Department of Agriculture (NIFA)


#### University of Idaho

```{r, message=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(readxl))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(knitr)

USDAUI  <- read.csv("USDAtoUI.csv")
knitr::kable(head(USDAUI))
```

### Department of Energy (DOE)


#### University of Idaho

```{r, message=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(readxl))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))
```

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(readxl)
DOEawardsUI <- read_xlsx("DOEawards.xlsx", .name_repair = "minimal")
```

```{r}
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)

DOEawardsUI <- read_xlsx("DOEawards.xlsx")

DOEUI_General <- DOEawardsUI %>% 
  dplyr::filter(Institution == 'Regents of the University of Idaho')

DOEUI_New_Awards <- DOEUI_General %>%
  select(Title, Institution, PI, Status, `Action Type`, `Program Office`, `Start Date`, `End Date`, `Most Recent Award Date`, `Amount Awarded to Date`)

knitr::kable(head(DOEUI_New_Awards))
library(tidyverse)

library(readr)
DOEawardsUI <- suppressMessages(read_xlsx("DOEawards.xlsx"))
```


### National Institutes of Health (NIH)

### National Science Foundation (NSF)


## QUESTION 1

Provide a visualization that shows our active awards from each sponsor. I need to see their start date and end date, the amount of the award, and the name of the Principal Investigator. I’m really interested in seeing how far into the future our current portfolio will exist. Are there a bunch of awards about to expire? Are there a bunch that just got funded and will be active for a while? Does this vary across sponsors?

## QUESTION 2

What is the proportional representation of new awards to the UI from these various sources over the past 5 to 10 years? Are there any trends that are encouraging or discouraging?

### Department of Energy (DOE)


## QUESTION 3

How is UI performing with these sponsors when compared to the following peer institutions?

1. Boise State University

**Department of Energy**
```{r}
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)

DOEawardsBSU <- read_xlsx("DOEawards.xlsx")

DOEBSU_General <- DOEawardsBSU %>% 
  dplyr::filter(Institution == 'Boise State University')

DOEBSU_New_Awards <- DOEBSU_General %>%
  select(Title, Institution, PI, Status, `Action Type`, `Program Office`, `Start Date`, `End Date`, `Most Recent Award Date`, `Amount Awarded to Date`)

knitr::kable(head(DOEBSU_New_Awards))
library(tidyverse)
```

**Department of Agriculture (NIFA)**

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(knitr)

BSUUSDA  <- read.csv("USDABSU.csv")
knitr::kable(head(BSUUSDA))
```


2. Idaho State University

DOEIDAHOSATTE_General <- DOEaward %>% 
  dplyr::filter(Institution == 'Idaho State University')

DOEDAHOSATTE_New_Awards <- DOEIDAHOSATTE_General %>%
  select(Title, Institution, PI, Status, `Action Type`, `Program Office`, `Start Date`, `End Date`, `Most Recent Award Date`, `Amount Awarded to Date`)

knitr::kable(head(DOEDAHOSATTE_New_Awards))
library(tidyverse)
```

**Department of Agriculture (NIFA)**

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(knitr)

knitr::kable(head(ISUUSDA))
```


3. Montana State University

**Department of Energy**
```{r}

  dplyr::filter(Institution == 'Montana State University')

DOEMONTANA_New_Awards <- DOEMONTANA_General %>%
  select(Title, Institution, PI, Status, `Action Type`, `Program Office`, `Start Date`, `End Date`, `Most Recent Award Date`, `Amount Awarded to Date`)

knitr::kable(head(DOEMONTANA_New_Awards))
library(tidyverse)
```


4. University of Montana

**Department of Energy**
```{r}
library(dplyr)

DOEUNIMONTANA_General <- DOEaward %>% 
  dplyr::filter(Institution == 'University of Montana')

DOEUNIMONTANA_New_Awards <- DOEUNIMONTANA_General %>%
  select(Title, Institution, PI, Status, `Action Type`, `Program Office`, `Start Date`, `End Date`, `Most Recent Award Date`, `Amount Awarded to Date`)

knitr::kable(head(DOEUNIMONTANA_New_Awards))
library(tidyverse)
```


5. Washington State University

**Department of Energy**
```{r}
library(dplyr)

DOEWSU_General <- DOEaward %>% 
  dplyr::filter(Institution == 'Washington State University')

DOEWSU_New_Awards <- DOEWSU_General %>%
  select(Title, Institution, PI, Status, `Action Type`, `Program Office`, `Start Date`, `End Date`, `Most Recent Award Date`, `Amount Awarded to Date`)

knitr::kable(head(DOEWSU_New_Awards))
library(tidyverse)
```


Note that “performing” can mean a variety of different things. You must choose your metrics of performance and justify them.
