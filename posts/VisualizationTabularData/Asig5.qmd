## DATA SET FOR NHL DRAFT PICKS
```{r}
library(readxl)
NHL_Drafts <- read_excel("NHLDraftsPicks.xlsx")

knitr::kable(head(NHL_Drafts,10))
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
Draft_2022 <- NHL_Drafts %>%
  filter(draftyear==2022)
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(Draft_2022, aes(x = round, y = NHLgames)) +
  geom_point()
```

**Figure 1:**The players that were drafted in June of 2022 didn’t play to much the last season.

Things wrong with this Data Visualization:

  1.**Overplotting:** All those points on the y=0 line represent about 32 players each. Can you         think of a way that adding extra channels might help?
  
  2.**Labelling:** Can we create a solid figure caption and better axis labels for this figure? In        your caption, please specify the task(s) the visualizaiton is intended to facilitate, as well       as the marks, channels, and key-value pairs used.
  
  3.**Key-Value pairs:** Looks like we are using “round” as a continuous variable. Can we change          this to an ordered factor?


```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggridges)

ggplot(Draft_2022, aes(x = NHLgames, y = factor(round))) +
  geom_density_ridges(aes(height = ..density..), jittered_points = TRUE, scale = 3) +  
  theme_minimal() +
  ggtitle("NHL 2022 Draft Players Density, Amplified") +
  xlab("NHL Games Played") + 
  ylab("Draft Round")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```


**Figure 2:**

```{r}
Draft_2021 <- NHL_Drafts %>%
  filter(draftyear==2021)
```

```{r}
Draft_2020 <- NHL_Drafts %>%
  filter(draftyear==2020)
```
