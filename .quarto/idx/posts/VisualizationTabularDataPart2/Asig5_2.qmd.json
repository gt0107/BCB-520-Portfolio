Unlike previous assignments, however, this time we will all be using the same data sets. I'm doing this because I want everyone to engage in the same logic process and have the same design objectives in mind.\n\n## LEARNING OBJECTIVES\n\n1.  Demonstrate that you can manipulate tabular data to facilitate different visualization tasks. The minimum skills are FILTERING, SELECTING, and SUMMARIZING, all while GROUPING these operations as dictated by your data.\n2.  Demonstrate that you can use tabular data to explore, analyze, and choose the most appropriate visualization idioms given a specific motivating question.\n3.  Demonstrate that you can Find, Access, and Integrate additional data in order to fully address the motivating question.\n\nThe scenario below will allow you to complete the assignment. It deals with data that are of the appropriate complexity and extent (number of observations and variables) to challenge you. If you want to use different data (yours or from another source) I am happy to work with you to make that happen!\n\n## SCENARIO\n\nImagine you are a high priced data science consultant. One of your good friends, Cassandra Canuck, is an Assistant General Manager for the Vancouver Canucks, a team in the National Hockey League with a long, long.... long history of futility.\n\nThis season feels different.\n\nThe Canucks are currently among the league leaders and appear to be on their way to their first playoff appearance in many years. A few weeks ago, the Vancouver Canucks decided to trade an underperforming player with a high upside and their first round draft pick to the Calgary Flames for Elias Lindholm, a very solid forward that might prove to be the missing piece of their Stanley Cup puzzle. Exciting!\n\nExcept that now the Canucks are struggling. They've lost 4 straight games and have seemingly lost their identity as a team. The fans are questioning whether the trade was worth it. Woe is me!\n\nFor the purposes of this exercise, let's set the 2024 NHL draft order using the [Tankathon Simulator](https://www.tankathon.com/nhl). The NHL uses a lottery system in which the teams lowest in the standings have the highest odds of getting the first overall pick. This year the Canucks are at the top of the league, and positioned to have the 31st overall pick. According to the simulator, Calgary will pick at number 2 (which is very valuable!), and the Canuck's pick at 31.\n\nHere is a screenshot:\n\n![](NHLlottery.png)\n\n### Here is the question:\n\nWas the trade worth it? This trade has a high likelihood of becoming what we call a **rental**. Elias Lindholm is on an expiring contract, meaning Vancouver is guaranteed to hold his contract only through the end of the season. They might be able to extend him, but that depends on the salary cap.\n\nMeanwhile, Calgary can draft a player at position 31, who may or may not turn out to be of equal or greater value than Lindholm.\n\nWas the trade worth it? Did Vancouver or Calgary \"win\" the trade?\n\nCan we make some visualizations that help us answer this question?\n\n[Here is an article](https://puckpedia.com/PerriPickValue) on modeling draft pick value!\n\n[Original analysis!](https://www.statsportsconsulting.com/2016/05/26/1658/?platform=hootsuite)\n\n[Eric Tulsky's original paper\\*](https://www.broadstreethockey.com/post/nhl-draft-pick-value-trading-up/)\n\n## DIRECTIONS\n\nCreate a new post in your portfolio for this assignment. Call it something cool, like NHL draft analysis, or Hockey Analytics, or John Wick....\n\nCopy the data files from the repository, and maybe also the .qmd file.\n\nUse the .qmd file as the backbone of your assignment, changing the code and the markdown text as you go.\n\n## THE DATA\n\nHow can we evaluate whether trading a first round pick for a rental player is a good idea? One approach is to look at the historical performance of players from various draft positions.\n\nI've created a data set that will allow us to explore player performance as a function of draft position. If you are curious as to how I obtained and re-arranged these data, you can check out that tutorial [here](../T6-APIsandJSON/index.qmd). For this assignment, though, I want to focus on the visualizations.\n\n```{r include=FALSE}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(readxl)\n\n```\n\n```{r}\n\nNHLDraft<-read.csv(\"NHLDraft.csv\")\nNHLDictionary<-read_excel(\"NHLDictionary.xlsx\")\n\nknitr::kable(NHLDictionary)\n```\n\nIn this case, we have a dataframe with all the drafted players from 2000-2018, their position, their draft year and position, and then rows for each season since being drafted (`postdraft`). The key variable here is `NHLgames`, which tells us how many games they played in the NHL each season since being drafted. Whether drafted players even make the NHL, and how many games they play, might be a good proxy to understand the value of a draft pick we just traded away.\n\n## SIMPLE SCATTERPLOT\n\nOne thing to realize about professional hockey is that it is pretty rare for a player to play in the NHL right after being drafted. Players get drafted when they are 18 years old, and they usually play in the juniors, minor leagues, or the NCAA for a bit to further develop.\n\nLet's use a scatterplot to visualize this phenomenon with the most recent draft classes.\n\n```{r}\ndraft2022<-NHLDraft%>%\n  filter(draftyear==2022 & postdraft==0)\n\nggplot(draft2022, aes(x=round, y=NHLgames))+\n  geom_point()\n\n```\n\nAs you can see, the players drafted in June of 2022 didn't play much last season. There are few things wrong with this visualization, however:\n\n1.  **Overplotting.** All those points on the y=0 line represent about 32 players each. Can you think of a way that adding extra channels might help?\n2.  **Labelling.** Can we create a solid figure caption and better axis labels for this figure? In your caption, please specify the task(s) the visualizaiton is intended to facilitate, as well as the marks, channels, and key-value pairs used.\n3.  **Key-Value pairs:** Looks like we are using \"round\" as a continuous variable. Can we change this to an ordered factor?\n\n## EXPANDED SCATTERPLOT\n\nThe data from the most recent drafts aren't really helpful for our question. Let's go back in time and use a draft year that has had some time to develop and reach their potential. How about 2018?\n\n```{r}\ndraft2018<-NHLDraft%>%\n  filter(draftyear==2018 & postdraft<6) \n\n# wondering why I've filtered postdraft to be less than 6?  Try removing that filter to see what happens.\n\nggplot(draft2018, aes(x=round, y=NHLgames))+\n  geom_point()\n\n```\n\nHmmm... in addition to the problem of overplotting, we've got an additional issue here. We actually have two keys and one attribute. The attribute is `NHLgames`, and the keys are `round` and `postdraft`, but we are only using round.\n\nPostdraft indicates the number of seasons after being drafted. We have several choices here. We can make a visualization that uses both keys, or we can somehow summarize the data for one of the keys.\n\nFor example, let's say we just wanted to know the TOTAL number of NHL games played since being drafted.\n\n```{r}\ndrafttot2018<- draft2018%>%\n  group_by(playerId, round, overall, position, name)%>%\n  summarise(totgames=sum(NHLgames))\n\nggplot(drafttot2018, aes(x=round, y=totgames))+\n  geom_point()\n\n```\n\nLook closely at the two graphs above. How are they different?\n\n## STOP AND REFLECT\n\nI've been a bit sneaky up to this point. You've probably been focusing primarily on my (crappy) visualizations. That's fine, but let's think about the manipulations to the [TABULAR DATA]{.red} I've had to perform.\n\nI'm using the [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org) to do these manipulations. I set up the original data frame to conform to the tidy data principles (every column is a variable, every row is an observation), which is pretty much the base form of how we've discussed [Tabular Data](../L6-TabularData1) in class.\n\nI've snuck in some functions that have allowed me to FILTER, GROUP, and SUMMARIZE the data, often creating new dataframes as I do so. Hey, look! [A handy cheatsheet for data transformation using the tidyverse!](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/data-transformation.pdf)\n\nThese functions come from the [dplyr package](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org) that gets installed as part of the tidyverse. The basic categories of actions are:\n\n-   mutate() adds new variables that are functions of existing variables\n-   select() picks variables based on their names.\n-   filter() picks cases based on their values.\n-   summarise() reduces multiple values down to a single summary.\n-   arrange() changes the ordering of the rows.\n\nAll of these work with group_by() so you can perform whichever operation on the groups that might be present in your data set.\n\nLet's get back to improving our understanding of the relative value of NHL draft picks. The figure above considers a single draft class (2018), and shows the total number of NHL games all the players have accumulated, separating each draft round on an ordinal x axis.\n\nFine, I guess, but we still have to deal with overplotting, and think about whether a scatterplot really helps us accomplish our task. For this figure do the following:\n\n1.  **Overplotting.** All those points on the y=0 line represent about 32 players each. Can you you think of a way that adding extra channels might help?\n2.  **Labelling.** Can we create a solid figure caption and better axis labels for this figure? In your caption, please specify the task(s) the visualizaiton is intended to facilitate, as well as the marks, channels, and key-value pairs used.\n3.  **Key-Value pairs:** Looks like we are using \"round\" as a continuous variable. Can we change this to an ordered factor?\n\n## SCATTERPLOT WITH OVERALL DRAFT POSITION\n\nThis approach might yield a better match with the scatterplot idiom. What if we ignore draft round, and use the player's overall draft position instead? It also might help us focus on our motivating question! What is the potential value of pick 31, and how does Elias Lindholm compare to that value?\n\n```{r}\n\nggplot(drafttot2018, aes(x=overall, y=totgames))+\n  geom_point()\n\n```\n\nFor this figure, address the following:\n\n1.  We are trying to address the notion of trading pick 31. How might you facilitate the task of evaluating picks in that range?\n2.  Create a caption and better axis labels for this figure.\n3.  What if we wanted to use more than just the 2018 draft class?\n\n## SCATTERPLOT SUMMARY\n\nWe seem to be running into an issue in terms of overplotting. Scatterplots are great, but they work best for two quantitative attributes, and we have a situation with one or two keys and one quantitative attribute. The thing is, scatterplots can be very useful when part of our workflow involves modeling the data in some way. We'll cover this kind of thing in future assignments, but just a bit of foreshadowing here:\n\n```{r}\n\nggplot(drafttot2018, aes(x=round, y=totgames))+\n  geom_point()+\n  geom_smooth()\n\n```\n\nAdding the smoothed line doesn't eliminate the overplotting problem, but it does indicate that it exists. We'll cover other potential solutions (such as box plots and violin plots) to this issue later in the course, when we get to the notions of faceting and data reduction.\n\nWhy not include all the data? A scatter plot with that many players (4775) isn't going to be great. But we could plot some sort of polynomial model to get a sense of the relationship between draft position and NHL games. We'll filter to the first 8 years of their career.\n\n```{r}\n\ndrafttot<- NHLDraft%>%\n  filter(postdraft<8)%>%\n  group_by(playerId, round, overall, position, name)%>%\n  summarise(totgames=sum(NHLgames))\n\n\nggplot(drafttot, aes(x=overall, y=totgames))+\n  geom_smooth()\n\n\n```\n\nOr we could visualize the average number of games played as a function of time since being drafted.\n\n```{r}\n\nggplot(NHLDraft, aes(x=postdraft, y=NHLgames))+\n  geom_smooth(aes(color=as.factor(round)))\n```\n\n\n\n## DIVERGENCE\n\nEnough esoteric wandering. The original version of this assignment focused on the relative value of draft picks in the NHL. This version has a more specific question. What might picks in the range of pick 31 conceivably yield? How often do picks in that range yield players of Elias Lindholm's value?\n\nI guess we'd better figure out what Elias Lindholm brings to the table.\n\nCan you find him in our existing data? Can you think of a way to highlight him in the context of number of games played? What other kinds of data might we need to fairly evaluate Lindholm and pick 31?\n\n::: callout-note\n## HINT\n\nIn the GitHub repository there is a file called `NHLdraftstats.csv`. What's in there?
