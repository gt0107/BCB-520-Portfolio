The minimum skills are FILTERING, SELECTING, and SUMMARIZING, all while GROUPING these operations as dictated by your data.\nDemonstrate that you can use tabular data to explore, analyze, and choose the most appropriate visualization idioms given a specific motivating question.\nDemonstrate that you can Find, Access, and Integrate additional data in order to fully address the motivating question.\n\nThe scenario below will allow you to complete the assignment. It deals with data that are of the appropriate complexity and extent (number of observations and variables) to challenge you. If you want to use different data (yours or from another source) I am happy to work with you to make that happen!"

    "text": "SCENARIO\nImagine you are a high priced data science consultant. One of your good friends, Cassandra Canuck, is an Assistant General Manager for the Vancouver Canucks, a team in the National Hockey League with a long, long…. long history of futility.\nThis season feels different.\nThe Canucks are currently among the league leaders and appear to be on their way to their first playoff appearance in many years. A few weeks ago, the Vancouver Canucks decided to trade an underperforming player with a high upside and their first round draft pick to the Calgary Flames for Elias Lindholm, a very solid forward that might prove to be the missing piece of their Stanley Cup puzzle. Exciting!\nExcept that now the Canucks are struggling. They’ve lost 4 straight games and have seemingly lost their identity as a team. The fans are questioning whether the trade was worth it. Woe is me!\nFor the purposes of this exercise, let’s set the 2024 NHL draft order using the Tankathon Simulator. The NHL uses a lottery system in which the teams lowest in the standings have the highest odds of getting the first overall pick. This year the Canucks are at the top of the league, and positioned to have the 31st overall pick. According to the simulator, Calgary will pick at number 2 (which is very valuable!), and the Canuck’s pick at 31.\nHere is a screenshot:\n\n\nHere is the question:\nWas the trade worth it? This trade has a high likelihood of becoming what we call a rental. Elias Lindholm is on an expiring contract, meaning Vancouver is guaranteed to hold his contract only through the end of the season. They might be able to extend him, but that depends on the salary cap.\nMeanwhile, Calgary can draft a player at position 31, who may or may not turn out to be of equal or greater value than Lindholm.\nWas the trade worth it? Did Vancouver or Calgary “win” the trade?\nCan we make some visualizations that help us answer this question?\nHere is an article on modeling draft pick value!\nOriginal analysis!\nEric Tulsky’s original paper*"

    "text": "THE DATA\nHow can we evaluate whether trading a first round pick for a rental player is a good idea? One approach is to look at the historical performance of players from various draft positions.\nI’ve created a data set that will allow us to explore player performance as a function of draft position. If you are curious as to how I obtained and re-arranged these data, you can check out that tutorial here. For this assignment, though, I want to focus on the visualizations.\n\n\nCode\nNHLDraft&lt;-read.csv(\"NHLDraft.csv\")\nNHLDictionary&lt;-read_excel(\"NHLDictionary.xlsx\")\n\nknitr::kable(NHLDictionary)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttribute\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ndraftyear\nOrdinal\nCalendar year in which the player was drafted into the NHL.\n\n\nname\nItem\nFull name of the player.\n\n\nround\nOrdinal\nRound in which the player was drafted (1 to 7).\n\n\noverall\nOrdinal\nOverall draft position of the player (1 to 224)\n\n\npickinRound\nOrdinal\nPosition in which the player was drafted in their round (1 to 32).\n\n\nheight\nQuantitative\nPlayer height in inches.\n\n\nweight\nQuantitative\nPlayer weight in pounds.\n\n\nposition\nCategorical\nPlayer position (Forward, Defense, Goaltender)\n\n\nplayerId\nItem\nUnique ID (key) assigned to each player.\n\n\npostdraft\nOrdinal\nNumber of seasons since being drafted (0 to 20).\n\n\nNHLgames\nQuantitative\nNumber of games played in the NHL in that particular season (regular season is 82 games, playoffs are up to 28 more).\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, we have a dataframe with all the drafted players from 2000-2018, their position, their draft year and position, and then rows for each season since being drafted (postdraft). The key variable here is NHLgames, which tells us how many games they played in the NHL each season since being drafted. Whether drafted players even make the NHL, and how many games they play, might be a good proxy to understand the value of a draft pick we just traded away.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHINT\n\n\n\nIn the GitHub repository there is a file called NHLdraftstats.csv. What’s in there? Can we use that information?"

Can you think of a way to highlight him in the context of number of games played? What other kinds of data might we need to fairly evaluate Lindholm and pick 31?"

The marks is still the same as the previous plot, but my channels I distorded. I changed the shape for each of the individual regions and its color. These makes it more distorted to understand the data."

The color scheme has no meaning that helps as a guide to perceive the highest and lowest count, which just makes it difficult to perceive at first glance."
