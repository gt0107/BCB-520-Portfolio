    "text": "In this blog post, you will get more insight into how much federal funding is awarded at the University of Idaho (UI) by the following federal agencies: the Department of Energy (DOE), the US Department of Agriculture (NIFA), the National Institute of Health (NIH), and National Science Foundation (NSF). These agencies provide funding to different types/ areas of research (agriculture, engineering, biology, computer science, physics, social science, etc.), and we want to determine how much money is going into these types of research. We also are looking at the timeline trend of how much funding is awarded at UI compared to previous years and if there’s any positive or negative impact. We can also see the longevity of the funding, like how long that funding is available. We also did a comparison between institutions in how much funding is awarded across institutions, we compared UI with Boise State University and Idaho State University. This information will provide a general understanding of where UI stands and how it competes with other institutions in acquiring federal funding from those agencies. By the end of this blog post, you will understand the distribution of awarded federal funding across these agencies."

    "text": "DATA VISUALIZATION AND ANALYSIS\nThe following visualizations is going to help us visualize UI’s longevity and distribution of the university’s portfolio of current and past awards. It will helps us identify if there are awards that are nearing their expiration.Also, will be doing a comparison with UI between two peer institutions: Boise State University and Idaho State University. This will help us understand UI’s performance in securing federal funding, and how those it measures up against to the other institutions within the same region.\n\nUniversity of Idaho - Current and Future Portfolio\nI am creating visualization that will displays the active awards from each sponsor, including their start and end dates, the amount of the award, and the name of the Principal Investigator. This will provide insights of the longevity of the University of Idaho current portfolio of awards. This will also help us identify what awards are near expiration, and which one ones has a longer duration, and to identify if any of these patterns may differ across federal agencies. Ultimately, these visualizations will provide an aid to have an understanding of the sustainability of UIs funding from different federal agencies.\nIn our first visualization (Figure 1), its a general overview of the longevity of our current active awards. By, looking at this Timeline chart, we can easily point out that our NSF awards has the longest longevity (meaning we will have funding until 2028). Looking at NIH and DOE awards timeline their awards are ending in the year 2024, that is something to keep in mind and following up with the PIs that have those funding to see if they applied for new grants.\nUSDA data was not added in this timeline chart beacuase it didnt provide an end date of their current active awards, so for this time of grant will be analyzed and visualized differently\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nQ1_Data &lt;- read_xlsx(\"Q1_Compilled_Data.xlsx\")\n\n# Convert StartDate and EndDate to Date objects\nQ1_Data$StartDate &lt;- as.Date(Q1_Data$StartDate, format = \"%m/%d/%Y\")\nQ1_Data$EndDate &lt;- as.Date(Q1_Data$EndDate, format = \"%m/%d/%Y\")\n\n# Filter out rows with NA values in StartDate or EndDate\nQ1_Data &lt;- Q1_Data[complete.cases(Q1_Data$StartDate, Q1_Data$EndDate), ]\n\n# Create the Gantt chart\n# Create the Gantt chart\nggplot(Q1_Data, aes(y = Sponsor, x = StartDate, xend = EndDate, yend = Sponsor)) +\n  geom_segment(size = 10, color = \"black\") +  #

    "text": "SCENARIO\nImagine you are a high priced data science consultant. One of your good friends, Cassandra Canuck, is an Assistant General Manager for the Vancouver Canucks, a team in the National Hockey League with a long, long…. long history of futility.\nThis season feels different.\nThe Canucks are currently among the league leaders and appear to be on their way to their first playoff appearance in many years. A few weeks ago, the Vancouver Canucks decided to trade an underperforming player with a high upside and their first round draft pick to the Calgary Flames for Elias Lindholm, a very solid forward that might prove to be the missing piece of their Stanley Cup puzzle. Exciting!\nExcept that now the Canucks are struggling. They’ve lost 4 straight games and have seemingly lost their identity as a team. The fans are questioning whether the trade was worth it. Woe is me!\nFor the purposes of this exercise, let’s set the 2024 NHL draft order using the Tankathon Simulator. The NHL uses a lottery system in which the teams lowest in the standings have the highest odds of getting the first overall pick. This year the Canucks are at the top of the league, and positioned to have the 31st overall pick. According to the simulator, Calgary will pick at number 2 (which is very valuable!), and the Canuck’s pick at 31.\nHere is a screenshot:\n\n\nHere is the question:\nWas the trade worth it? This trade has a high likelihood of becoming what we call a rental. Elias Lindholm is on an expiring contract, meaning Vancouver is guaranteed to hold his contract only through the end of the season. They might be able to extend him, but that depends on the salary cap.\nMeanwhile, Calgary can draft a player at position 31, who may or may not turn out to be of equal or greater value than Lindholm.\nWas the trade worth it? Did Vancouver or Calgary “win” the trade?\nCan we make some visualizations that help us answer this question?\nHere is an article on modeling draft pick value!\nOriginal analysis!\nEric Tulsky’s original paper*"

One approach is to look at the historical performance of players from various draft positions.\nI’ve created a data set that will allow us to explore player performance as a function of draft position. If you are curious as to how I obtained and re-arranged these data, you can check out that tutorial here.

The key variable here is NHLgames, which tells us how many games they played in the NHL each season since being drafted.

The NHL player Elias Lindholm was drafted in this year 2013 in the first round pick.\n\n\nElias Lindholm Performance\nSince, we looked at the overall pick of players that were drafted in 2013, I wanted to look were Elias Lindholm performance lies post draft.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nNHLdraftstats &lt;- read.csv(\"NHLdraftstats.csv\")\n\n\nElias_stats &lt;- NHLdraftstats %&gt;%\n  filter(name == \"Elias Lindholm\")\n\nggplot(Elias_stats, aes(x=postdraft, y=NHLgames)) +\n  geom_smooth() +  \n  theme_minimal() +\n  ggtitle(\"Elias Lindholm Performance\") +\n  xlab(\"Post Draft Position\") +  \n  ylab(\"NHL Games Played\") + \n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: This line graph represent Elias Lindholm post draft, and we can see that at the beginning of being drafted has played a lot of NHL games, meaning that he is an outstanding player.\n\n\n2013 Draft Pick by Positions\nElias Lindholm is in the forward position, I wanted to see how many players got drafted from the same position in contrast to the other positions.\n\n\nCode\nplayers_stats_2013 &lt;- NHLdraftstats %&gt;%\n  filter(draftyear == 2013)\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nagg_data &lt;- players_stats_2013 %&gt;%\n  group_by(round, position) %&gt;%\n  summarise(AvgNHLGames = mean(NHLgames, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = 'drop')\n\n\nggplot(agg_data, aes(x = factor(round), y = AvgNHLGames, fill = factor(round))) +\n  geom_col() +\n  facet_wrap(~position, scales = \"free_y\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  ggtitle(\"Average NHL Games Played by Draft Round and Position (2013)\") +\n  xlab(\"Draft Round\") +\n  ylab(\"Average NHL Games Played\") +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set1\", name = \"Draft Round\") +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),\n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, size = 12))\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure3: The following bar graphs are divided by position, by round and the average of NHL played games from the players that were drafted in 2013. By looking at this graphs we can say that the positions for forward and defense are highly drafted in the first round and are the ones that played the most in NHL games. The Goal Tender there’s no overall pick in this 2013 draft pick. Meaning that these two positions for defense and forward are the most highly looked for selecting players.\n\n\nElias Lindholm vs Drafted Players 2013 Performance\nWe now that Elias Lindholm has a good performance after being drafted. I wanted to compare with the other players that were also drafted on 2013. This will help me have a perspective why Calgary did the trade with Vancouver for him.\n\n\nCode\nplayers_stats_2013 &lt;- NHLdraftstats %&gt;%\n  filter(draftyear == 2013)\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Calculate the average NHL games played by players other than Elias Lindholm\naverage_games &lt;- players_stats_2013 %&gt;%\n  filter(name != \"Elias Lindholm\") %&gt;%\n  summarise(average_NHL_games = mean(NHLgames, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n# Calculate Elias Lindholm's average NHL games\nelias_avg_games &lt;- players_stats_2013 %&gt;%\n  filter(name == \"Elias Lindholm\") %&gt;%\n  summarise(NHLgames = mean(NHLgames, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(name = \"Elias Lindholm\", category = \"Individual\")\n\n# Create a data frame for the draft average\naverage_df &lt;- data.frame(\n  name = \"2013 Draft Average\",\n  NHLgames = average_games$average_NHL_games,\n  category = \"Average\"\n)\n\n# Ensure both data frames have the same structure and combine them\ncomparison_data &lt;- rbind(elias_avg_games, average_df)\n\n# Create the bar graph comparing Elias Lindholm's NHL games played to the 2013 draft average\nggplot(comparison_data, aes(x = name, y = NHLgames, fill = category)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  ggtitle(\"Elias Lindholm vs. 2013 Draft Average NHL Games Played\") +\n  xlab(\"Category\") +\n  ylab(\"NHL Games Played\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Average\" = \"red\", \"Individual\" = \"blue\")) +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), axis.text.x = element_blank())\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: In this bar graph is comparison between the performance of Elias Lindholm vs the drafted players of 2013. I took the average of the NHL games played of the drafted players (is the one label as average and the blue bar) and also the average for Elias’s performance (is the one label as individual and the red bar). By looking at this graph we can say that Elias’s performance is alot higher than the overall average of the players that were drafted at the same year as Elias.\n\n\nElias Lindholm vs Forward Players (Drafted in 2013)\nWe now that Elias Lindholm has a good performance after being drafted compared to other players that were drafted on the same year. Now, I wanted to compare the performance with players that have the same position as Elias. This also, will give more insight the decision of the trade.\n\n\nCode\nforwards_2013 &lt;- players_stats_2013 %&gt;%\n  filter(draftyear == 2013, position == \"Forward\") %&gt;%\n  select(name, position, NHLgames) \n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n# Mark Elias Lindholm and other players\nplayers_stats_2013 &lt;- players_stats_2013 %&gt;%\n  mutate(Category = ifelse(name == \"Elias Lindholm\", \"Elias Lindholm\", \"Other Players\"))\n\n# Calculate average NHL games for Elias and other players\navg_games_comparison &lt;- players_stats_2013 %&gt;%\n  group_by(Category) %&gt;%\n  summarise(AverageNHLGames = mean(NHLgames, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n# Plot\nggplot(avg_games_comparison, aes(x = Category, y = AverageNHLGames, fill = Category)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  ggtitle(\"Average NHL Games: Elias Lindholm vs Other Forwards (2013 Draft)\") +\n  xlab(\"\") +\n  ylab(\"Average NHL Games Played\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Elias Lindholm\" = \"blue\", \"Other Players\" = \"red\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: In this bar graph is comparison between the performance of Elias Lindholm vs the players on the same position as forward. I took the average of the NHL games played of the drafted players (is the one label as Other Players) and also the average for Elias’s performance (Blue bar). By looking at this graph we can say that Elias’s performance is alot higher than the overall average of the players that were drafted at the same year as Elias in the postion as forward.\n\n\nElias Lindholm vs. Forwards (Drafted in 2018)\nWe now that Elias Lindholm has a good performance, now I wanted to compare its performance with forward players that were drafted in 2018. It is clear that Elias has more experience and has alot of exposure in playing alot of NHL games. I just wanted to see and compare their performances between the two variables. Like having an experience player is better than acquiring new players.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nplayers_stats_2018 &lt;- NHLdraftstats %&gt;%\n  filter(draftyear == 2018, position == \"Forward\") %&gt;%\n  select(name, position, NHLgames) \n\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Assuming Elias Lindholm is also a forward and you want his stats\nelias_metric &lt;- NHLdraftstats %&gt;%\n  filter(name == \"Elias Lindholm\", position == \"Forward\") %&gt;%\n  summarise(AverageNHLGames = mean(NHLgames, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n# Calculate the average NHL games for forwards drafted in 2018\navg_2018_metric &lt;- players_stats_2018 %&gt;%\n  filter(position == \"Forward\") %&gt;%\n  summarise(AverageNHLGames = mean(NHLgames, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n# Combine the data for comparison\ncomparison_data &lt;- rbind(\n  data.frame(Name = \"Elias Lindholm\", Metric = elias_metric$AverageNHLGames),\n  data.frame(Name = \"2018 Forwards\", Metric = avg_2018_metric$AverageNHLGames)\n)\n\n# Plot the comparison\nggplot(comparison_data, aes(x = Name, y = Metric, fill = Name)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  ggtitle(\"Comparison: Elias Lindholm vs. 2018 Forwards\") +\n  ylab(\"Average NHL Games Played\") +\n  xlab(\"\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Elias Lindholm\" = \"blue\", \"2018 Forwards\" = \"red\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: In this bar graph is comparison between the performance of Elias Lindholm vs forward players drafted in 2018. I took the average of the NHL games played of the 2018 Forwards (Red Bar) and also the average for Elias’s performance (Blue bar). By looking at this graph we can say that Elias’s performance is alot higher than the overall average of the Forward players that were drafted in 2018. But, this is also due that Elias has alot more experience than the players drafted in 2018."

    "text": "CONCLUSION\nBased on my visualizations, I think the Vancouver Canucks got a good trade with Elias Lindholm. He’s a solid forward based on the comparison data of other players in the same position in the same draft year; Elias Lindholm is a player in another league. Maybe, the reason that the Canucks made the trade with the Calgary Flames; is that they needed a player that could bring them the win of the Stanley Cup. The Canucks are thinking about their current gaming plan; and not too much about the future. Maybe the Calgary Flames wanted new players to improve their gaming strategies, and have a solid team for the future NHL games."
