### Data Set Type

#### **Flat Table - Video Games Sales** 

We have a **Flat Table**, the **items** are the rows, wherein each row is the different types of games that has been released from 1983 - 2012. Each item (games) is described by attributes, which are put in columns. Those **attributes** represent: index, rank, game title, platform, year, genre, publisher, US, Europe, Japan, Rest of the Word, Global (total of sales), and reviews. For each column of the different countries represent the total sales from each one in terms of millions in sales.

```{r}
#| output: true
library(readxl)
my_df <- read_excel("Video Games Sales.xlsx")
knitr::kable(head(my_df,10))
library(tidyverse)
```

## ATTRIBUTE TYPES

* **Categorical:** game title, platform, year, genre, publisher
* **Ordinal:** Index, ranking
* **Quantitative:** US (sales in millions), Europe (sales in millions), Japan (sales in millions), rest of the word (sales in millions), global  (sales in millions), reviews in the sales

## WHAT DO I WANT FROM THIS DATA?

1. What was the highest video game sale from each country?
2. What was the most popular console (platform) for each country?
3. Which of the genres are most or/and less popular for each region?

### Histogram Graph

This first graph shows the distribution of game genre across the 100,000 game titles from 1983-2012. We have approximately 300 game titles in the sports. In close second is action and third shooter.

```{r}


title_genre<-my_df%>%
  select(Genre,`Game Title`)%>%
  group_by(Genre, `Game Title`)%>%
  summarise(count=n_distinct('Game Title'))%>%
  group_by(Genre) %>%
  summarise(TotalCount = sum(count))

  
ggplot(title_genre, aes(x = Genre, y=TotalCount,fill = Genre)) +
  geom_col(color = "black", width = 0.7) +
  ggtitle("Genre Distribution") +
  xlab("Genre") +
  ylab("Game Titles") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))


ggplot(my_df, aes(x = Genre, fill = Genre)) +
  geom_bar(color = "black", width = 0.7) +
  ggtitle("Genre Distribution") +
  xlab("Genre") +
  ylab("Game Titles") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

This second graph shows the platform (game console) distribution across the 100,000 game titles from 1983-2012. We have approximately more than 300 games titles for the PS2 console, in second is PS, and third XBOX 360.

```{r}
ggplot(my_df, aes(x = Platform, fill = Platform)) +
  geom_bar(color = "black", width = 0.7) +
  ggtitle("Platform Distribution") +
  xlab("Platform") +
  ylab("Game Titles") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

### Scatter Plot

```{r}
ggplot(my_df, aes(x = Platform, y = 'North America')) +
  geom_point(color = "darkblue") +
  ggtitle("Scatter Plot: Platform vs. North America") +
  xlab("Platform") +
  ylab("North America") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),
        axis.title.x = element_text(margin = margin(t = 10)))  
```

```{r}
ggplot(my_df, aes(x = Platform, y = Japan)) +
  geom_point(color = "orange") +
  ggtitle("Scatter Plot: Platform vs. Japan") +
  xlab("Platform") +
  ylab("Japan") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),
        axis.title.x = element_text(margin = margin(t = 10)))  
```

```{r}
ggplot(my_df, aes(x = Platform, y = Europe)) +
  geom_point(color = "purple") +
  ggtitle("Scatter Plot: Platform vs. Europe") +
  xlab("Platform") +
  ylab("Europe") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),
        axis.title.x = element_text(margin = margin(t = 10)))  
```
