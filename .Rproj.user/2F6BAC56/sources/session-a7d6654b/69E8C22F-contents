### Bar Graph

This first graph shows the distribution of game genre across the 100,000 game titles from 1983-2012. We have approximately 300 game titles in the sports. In close second is action and third shooter.

```{r}
title_genre<-my_df%>%
  select(Genre,`Game Title`)%>%
  group_by(Genre, `Game Title`)%>%
  summarise(count=n_distinct('Game Title'))%>%
  group_by(Genre) %>%
  summarise(TotalCount = sum(count))

suppressMessages({itle_genre<-my_df%>%
  select(Genre,`Game Title`)%>%
  group_by(Genre, `Game Title`)%>%
  summarise(count=n_distinct('Game Title'))%>%
  group_by(Genre) %>%
  summarise(TotalCount = sum(count))})



library(ggplot2)

title_genre$Genre <- reorder(title_genre$Genre, title_genre$TotalCount)

ggplot(data = title_genre, aes(x = Genre, y = TotalCount, fill = Genre)) +
  geom_col(color = "black", width = 0.7) +
  ggtitle("Genre Distribution") +
  xlab("Genre") +
  ylab("Game Titles") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```
