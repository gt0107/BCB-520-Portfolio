## DATA SET FOR NHL DRAFT PICKS
```{r}
library(readxl)
NHL_Drafts <- read_excel("NHLDraftsPicks.xlsx")

knitr::kable(head(NHL_Drafts,10))
library(tidyverse)
```

## SIMPLE SCATTERPLOT

```{r}
Draft_2022 <- NHL_Drafts %>%
  filter(draftyear==2022)
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(Draft_2022, aes(x = round, y = NHLgames)) +
  geom_point()
```

**Figure 1:**The players that were drafted in June of 2022 didn’t play to much the last season.

Things wrong with this Data Visualization:

  1.**Overplotting:** All those points on the y=0 line represent about 32 players each. Can you         think of a way that adding extra channels might help?
  
  2.**Labelling:** Can we create a solid figure caption and better axis labels for this figure? In        your caption, please specify the task(s) the visualizaiton is intended to facilitate, as well       as the marks, channels, and key-value pairs used.
  
  3.**Key-Value pairs:** Looks like we are using “round” as a continuous variable. Can we change          this to an ordered factor?


```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggridges)

Draft_2022$round <- factor(Draft_2022$round, levels = sort(unique(Draft_2022$round)), ordered = TRUE)

ggplot(Draft_2022, aes(x = NHLgames, y = round)) +
  geom_density_ridges(aes(height = ..density..), jittered_points = TRUE, scale = 3) +
  theme_minimal() +
  ggtitle("NHL 2022 Draft Players Density") +
  xlab("NHL Games Played") + 
  ylab("Draft Round")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

## EXPANDED SCATTERPLOT

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

Draft_2018 <- NHL_Drafts %>%
  filter(draftyear == 2018 & postdraft < 6)

ggplot(Draft_2018, aes(x = round, y = NHLgames)) +
  geom_point()
```

**Figure 1:**

```{r}
SummaryDraft2018 <- Draft_2018 %>%
  group_by(playerId, round, overall, position, name) %>%
  summarise(totgames=sum(NHLgames))

ggplot(SummaryDraft2018, aes(x=round, y=totgames))+
  geom_point()
```

**Figure 2:**

  1.**Overplotting:** All those points on the y=0 line represent about 32 players each. Can you         think of a way that adding extra channels might help?
  
  2.**Labelling:** Can we create a solid figure caption and better axis labels for this figure? In        your caption, please specify the task(s) the visualizaiton is intended to facilitate, as well       as the marks, channels, and key-value pairs used.
  
  3.**Key-Value pairs:** Looks like we are using “round” as a continuous variable. Can we change          this to an ordered factor?

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

SummaryDraft2018 <- Draft_2018 %>%
  group_by(playerId, round, overall, position, name) %>%
  summarise(totgames = sum(NHLgames, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = 'drop')  # Handle NA values

SummaryDraft2018$round <- factor(SummaryDraft2018$round, 
                                 levels = sort(unique(SummaryDraft2018$round)), 
                                 ordered = TRUE)

ggplot(SummaryDraft2018, aes(x = round, y = totgames, color = position)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  ggtitle("Total NHL Games by Draft Round (2018)") +
  xlab("Draft Round") +
  ylab("Total NHL Games Played") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

**Figure 3:** In your caption, please specify the task(s) the visualization is intended to facilitate, as well as the marks, channels, and key-value pairs used.

##SCATTERPLOT WITH OVERALL DRAFT POSITION

```{R}
ggplot(SummaryDraft2018, aes(x=overall, y=totgames))+
  geom_point()
```

**Figure 4:**

  1.We are trying to address the notion of trading a pick from round 1 for picks from round 2 and 3. Add visual channels to        this plot that will help us make that decision.
  
  2.Create a caption and better axis labels for this figure.
  
  3.What if we wanted to use more than just the 2018 draft class?
